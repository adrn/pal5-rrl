title = {High-Redshift Galaxy Kinematics: Constraints on Models of Disk Formation},
abstract = {Integral field spectroscopy of galaxies at redshift z~2 has revealed a population of early-forming, rotationally-supported disks. These high-redshift systems provide a potentially important clue to the formation processes that build disk galaxies in the universe. A particularly well-studied example is the z=2.38 galaxy BzK-15504, which was shown by Genzel et al. (2006) to be a rotationally supported disk despite the fact that its high star formation rate and short gas consumption timescale require a very rapid acquisition of mass. Previous kinematical analyses have suggested that z~2 disk galaxies like BzK-15504 did not form through mergers because their line-of-sight velocity fields display low levels of asymmetry. We perform the same kinematical analysis on a set of simulated disk galaxies formed in gas-rich mergers of the type that may be common at high redshift, and show that the remnant disks display low velocity field asymmetry and satisfy the criteria that have been used to classify high-redshift galaxies as disks observationally. Further, we compare one of our remnants to the bulk properties of BzK-15504 and show that it has a star formation rate, gas surface density, and a circular velocity-to-velocity dispersion ratio that matches BzK-15504 remarkably well. We suggest that observations of high-redshift disk galaxies like BzK-15504 are consistent with the hypothesis that gas-rich mergers play an important role in disk formation at high redshift.},

title = {Galactic Dynamics and Local Dark Matter},
abstract = { The concordance Lambda Cold Dark Matter (Lambda-CDM) model for the formation of structure in the Universe, while remarkably successful at describing observations of structure on large scales, continues to be challenged by observations on galactic scales. Fortunately, CDM models and their various proposed alternatives make a rich variety of testable predictions that make the Local Group and our own Milky Way Galaxy key laboratories for exploring dark matter (DM) in this regime. However, some of the most definitive tests of local DM require microarcsecond astrometry of faint sources, an astrometric regime that is a unique niche of SIM Lite. This chapter explores the important and distinct contributions that can be made by SIM Lite in the exploration of galaxy dynamics and DM on galaxy scales and that have cosmological consequences. Key areas of potential SIM Lite exploration include (1) measuring the shape, orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark halo of the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies, (2) determining the orbits of Galactic satellites, which may be representatives of late infall from the hierarchical formation of the Milky Way, (3) ascertaining the distribution of angular momentum and orbital anisotropy of stars and globular clusters to the outer reaches of the Galactic halo, dynamical properties that hold clues to the early hierarchical formation of the Galaxy, (4) measuring the physical nature of DM by placing strong constraints on the phase space density in the cores of nearby dSph galaxies, and (5) reconstructing the dynamical history of the Local Group through the determination of orbits and masses of its constituent galaxies. },

title = {Proper Motions in Kapteyn Selected Area 103: A Preliminary Orbit for the Virgo Stellar Stream},
abstract = {We present absolute proper motions in Kapteyn Selected Area (SA) 103. This field is located 7 degrees west of the center of the Virgo Stellar Stream (VSS, Duffau et al. 2006), and has a well-defined main sequence representing the stream. In SA 103 we identify one RR Lyrae star as a member of the VSS according to its metallicity, radial velocity and distance. VSS candidate turnoff stars and subgiant stars have proper motions consistent with that of the RR Lyrae star. The 3D velocity data imply an orbit with a pericenter of 11 kpc and an apocenter of ~90 kpc. Thus, the VSS comprises tidal debris found near the pericenter of a highly destructive orbit. Examining the six globular clusters at distances larger than 50 kpc from the Galactic center, and the proposed orbit of the VSS, we find one tentative association, NGC 2419. We speculate that NGC 2419 is possibly the nucleus of a disrupted system of which the VSS is a part.},

title = {Bias Properties of Extragalactic Distance Indicators.XI. Methods to Correct for Observational Selection Bias for RR Lyrae Absolute Magnitudes from Trigonometric Parallaxes Expected from the FAME Astrometric Satellite},
abstract = {Please note that this abstract has been shortened from that found in the paper. A brief history is given of the development of the correction for observation selection bias inherent in the calibration of absolute magnitudes using trigonometric parallaxes. As a tutorial to gain an intuitive understanding of several complicated trigonometric bias problems, we study a toy bias model of a parallax catalog which incorporates assumed parallax measuring errors of various severities. The two effects of bias errors on the derived absolute magnitudes are (1) the Lutz-Kelker correction itself that depends on the fractional parallax error and the spatial distribution, and (2) a Malmquist-like `incompleteness' correction of opposite sign due to various apparent magnitude cut-offs as they are progressively imposed on the catalog. The simulations involve 3 million stars spread with varying density distributions in a volume bounded by a radius of 50,000 pc. A fixed absolute magnitude of M_V = +0.6 is used to imitate RR Lyrae variables in the mean. The bias is demonstrated for various assumed spatial densities and parallax error models, including one that is projected for the FAME satellite. The effects of imposing magnit ude limits and limits on the `observer's' error are displayed. We contrast the method of calculating mean absolute magnitude directly from the parallaxes where bias corrections are mandatory, with an inverse method using maximum likelihood which is free of the Lutz-Kelker bias, although a Malmquist bias is present. We discuss the level of accuracy that can be expected in a calibration of RR Lyrae absolute magnitudes from the FAME data over the metallicity range of [Fe/H] from 0 to -2, given the known frequency of the local RR Lyraes closer than 1.5 kpc.},

title = {Galactic stellar haloes in the CDM model},
abstract = {We present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidal disruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. Our model is based on the Aquarius project, a suite of high resolution N-body simulations of individual dark matter haloes. We tag subsets of particles in these simulations with stellar populations predicted by the Galform semi-analytic model. Our method self-consistently tracks the dynamical evolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. The luminosity function and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree well with observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. We find that accreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1<z<7 from less than 5 significant progenitors. These progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites with stellar masses similar to the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidals. In contrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of these major contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. Both the number of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherently stochastic. This results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, which amplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halo hosts. The masses and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloes are consistent with expectations from the Milky Way and M31. Each halo has a complex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shells and other subcomponents. This structure is not adequately described by smooth models. We find one example of an accreted thick disk. Contrasts in age and metallicity between halo stars and those in surviving satellites are in broad agreement with recent observations. [Abridged]},

abstract = {We present a theoretical calibration of the RR Lyrae period-luminosity (PL) relation in the UBVRIJHK Johnson-Cousins-Glass system. Our theoretical work is based on calculations of synthetic horizontal branches (HBs) for several different metallicities, fully taking into account evolutionary effects besides the effect of chemical composition. Extensive tabulations of our results are provided, including convenient analytical formulae for the calculation of the coefficients of the period-luminosity relation in the different passbands as a function of HB type. We also provide ``average'' PL relations in IJHK, for applications in cases where the HB type is not known a priori; as well as a new calibration of the MV-[M/H] relation.

abstract = {All techniques that derive M(V) or M(bol) as a function of Fe/H for RR Lyrae variables are summarized. Recent results from main-sequence fitting are revised to account for metallicity-dependent errors in B - V from model isochrones; M(V)(RR) is found to vary as 0.12(Fe/H). The equilibrium temperature scale is redefined for RR Lyrae stars, and the period-shift analyses for RR Lyrae stars in globular clusters and in the field are readdressed. All methods agree that, within the errors, M(V)(RR) varies as 0.15(Fe/H) and M(bol)(RR) varies as 0.19(Fe/H). If O/Fe = 0.3, the Galaxy's age may be as high as 20 +/-3 Gyr, and the most metal-poor clusters are on average older than the more metal-rich ones. If O/Fe varies as -0.4(Fe/H), the Galaxy's age is about 14 +/-2 Gyr, and the cluster's ages do not correlate with metallicity. Regardless of the oxygen abundance, there is a significant range in ages among the intermediate-metallicity clusters.},

abstract = {We present a new framework to detect various types of variable objects within massive astronomical time-series data. Assuming that the dominant population of objects is non-variable, we find outliers from this population by using a non-parametric Bayesian clustering algorithm based on an infinite GaussianMixtureModel (GMM) and the Dirichlet Process. The algorithm extracts information from a given dataset, which is described by six variability indices. The GMM uses those variability indices to recover clusters that are described by six-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distributions, allowing our approach to consider the sampling pattern of time-series data, systematic biases, the number of data points for each light curve, and photometric quality. Using the Northern Sky Variability Survey data, we test our approach and prove that the infinite GMM is useful at detecting variable objects, while providing statistical inference estimation that suppresses false detection. The proposed approach will be effective in the exploration of future surveys such as GAIA, Pan-Starrs, and LSST, which will produce massive time-series data.},

abstract = {We first present a self-consistent dynamical model in which ω Cen is formed from an ancient nucleated dwarf galaxy merging with the first generation of the Galactic thin disc in a retrograde manner with respect to the Galactic rotation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that during merging between the Galaxy and the ω Cen host dwarf with MB~=-14 mag and its nucleus mass of 107 Msolar, the outer stellar envelope of the dwarf is nearly completely stripped, whereas the central nucleus can survive from the tidal stripping because of its compactness. The developed naked nucleus has a very bound retrograde orbit around the young Galactic disc, as observed for ω Cen, with apocentre and pericentre distances of ~8 and ~1 kpc, respectively. The Galactic tidal force can induce radial inflow of gas to the centre of the dwarf and consequently triggers moderately strong nuclear starbursts in a repetitive manner. This result implies that efficient nuclear chemical enrichment resulting from the later starbursts can be closely associated with the origin of the observed relatively young and metal-rich stars in ω Cen. Dynamical heating by the ω Cen host can transform the young thin disc into the thick disc during merging.},

When combined with data from other surveys, the run of RR Lyrae star densities covering a very wide range of galactocentric distances is available. The chemical abundances of these probe stars show a very wide spread of metallicity, [Fe/H] from -1.0 to -2.2. However, no net abundance gradient is seen in the far halo. From the radial velocities, the kinematics of these stars has been studied. The mass of the Galaxy within 25 kpc is derived via dynamical arguments to be about 3×1011M_sun;.},

title = {Large Scale Structure},
abstract = {Catalogues of galaxies, clusters of galaxies and superclusters - sources of information to study the large-scale structure of the Universe are reviewed. The power spectrum of density perturbations, and the correlation function are discussed as principal description functions which characterize the large-scale structure. Special attention is payd to the geometric interpretation of these functions, i.e. the way in which the various properties of the distribution of galaxies in systems and systems themselves are reflected in these functions. We discuss cosmological parameters which characterize general properties of the Universe: the Hubble constant, densities of various populations of the Universe, and parameters of the power spectrum of galaxies and matter.},

title = {Substructure in Tidal Streams; Tributaries in the Anticenter Ring},
abstract = {We report on the detection in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data of at least three, roughly parallel components in a 65 degree-long stellar stream complex previously identified with the Anticenter or Monoceros Ring. The three-stream complex varies in width from 4 to 6 degrees along its length and appears to be made up of two or more narrow substreams as well as a broader, diffuse component. The width and complexity of the stream indicate that the progenitor was likely a dwarf galaxy of significant size and mass. The stream is 8.9 kpc distant and is oriented almost perpendicularly to our line of sight. The visible portion of the stream does not pass near any known dwarf galaxies and a preliminary orbit does not point to any viable progenitor candidates. Orbits for the narrower substreams can be modeled with velocity offsets from the broad component of about 8 km/s. We suggest that the broad component is likely to be the remains of a dwarf galaxy, while the narrower streams constitute the remnants of dynamically distinct components which may have included a native population of globular clusters. While the color of the main sequence turn-off is not unlike that for the Monoceros Ring, neither the visible stream nor any reasonable projection of its orbit passes through Monoceros or Canis Major, and we conclude that this stream is probably unrelated to the overdensities found in these regions.},

title = {Simulations of Galaxy Formation in a Λ Cold Dark Matter Universe. II. The Fine Structure of Simulated Galactic Disks},
abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the disk component of a simulated galaxy formed in the ΛCDM cosmogony. At redshift z=0, two distinct dynamical components are easily identified solely on the basis of the orbital parameters of stars in the galaxy: a slowly rotating, centrally concentrated spheroid and a disklike component largely supported by rotation. The disk may be further decomposed into a thin, dynamically cold component with stars on nearly circular orbits and a hotter, thicker component with orbital parameters transitional between the thin disk and the spheroid. Supporting evidence for the presence of distinct thick- and thin-disk components is provided, as in the Milky Way, by the double-exponential vertical structure of the disk and in abrupt changes in the vertical velocity distribution as a function of stellar age. The dynamical origin of these components offers intriguing clues to the assembly of spheroids and disks in the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies. The spheroid is old and has essentially no stars younger than the time elapsed since the last major accretion event, ~8 Gyr ago for the system we consider here. The majority of thin-disk stars, on the other hand, form after the merging activity is over, although a significant fraction (~15%) of thin-disk stars are old enough to predate the last major merger event. This unexpected population of old-disk stars consists mainly of the tidal debris of satellites whose orbital plane was coincident with the disk and whose orbits were circularized by dynamical friction prior to full disruption. More than half of the stars in the thick disk share this origin, part of a trend that becomes more pronounced with age: 9 out of 10 stars presently in the old (age of >~10 Gyr) disk component were actually brought into the disk by satellites. By contrast, only one in two stars belonging to the old spheroid are tidal debris; the rest may be traced to a major merger event that dispersed the luminous progenitor at z~1.5 and seeded the formation of the spheroid. Our results highlight the role of satellite accretion events in shaping the disk, as well as the spheroidal, component and reveal some of the clues to the assembly process of a galaxy preserved in the detailed dynamics of old stellar populations.},

We use density fields and the friends-of-friends algorithm to identify the members of superclusters of Abell clusters among the Las Campanas loose groups. We find that systems of loose groups tend to be oriented perpendicularly to the line-of-sight, and discuss possible reasons for that. We show that loose groups in richer systems (superclusters of Abell clusters) are themselves also richer and more massive than groups in systems without Abell clusters. Our results indicate that superclusters, as high density environments, have a major role in the formation and evolution of galaxy systems.},

title = {Great Circle Tidal Streams: Evidence for a Nearly Spherical Massive Dark Halo around the Milky Way},
abstract = {An all-high-latitude sky survey for cool carbon giant stars in the Galactic halo has revealed 75 such stars, of which the majority are new detections. Of these, more than half are clustered on a great circle on the sky that intersects the center of Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and is parallel to its proper-motion vector, while many of the remainder are outlying Magellanic Cloud carbon stars. Previous numerical experiments regarding the disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (the closest of the Galactic satellite galaxies) predicted that the effect of the strong tides, during its repeated close encounters with the Milky Way, would be to slowly disrupt that galaxy. Because of the small velocity dispersion of the disrupted particles, these disperse slowly along (approximately) the orbital path of the progenitor, eventually giving rise to a very long stream of tidal debris surrounding our Galaxy. The more recently disrupted fragments of this stream should contain a mix of stellar populations similar to that found in the progenitor, which includes giant carbon stars. Given the measured position and velocity of the Sagittarius dwarf, we first integrate its orbit assuming a standard spherical model for the Galactic potential and find both that the path of the orbit intersects the position of the stream and that the radial velocity of the orbit, as viewed from the solar position, agrees very well with the observed radial velocities of the carbon stars. We also present a pole-count analysis of the carbon star distribution, which clearly indicates that the great circle stream we have isolated is statistically significant, being a 5-6 σ overdensity. These two arguments strongly support our conclusion that a large fraction of the halo carbon stars originated in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The stream orbits the Galaxy between the present location of the Sagittarius dwarf, 16 kpc from the Galactic center, and the most distant stream carbon star, at ~60 kpc. It follows neither a polar nor a Galactic plane orbit, so that a large range in both Galactic R- and z-distances is probed. That the stream is observed as a great circle indicates that the Galaxy does not exert a significant torque on the stream, so the Galactic potential must be nearly spherical in the regions probed by the stream. Furthermore, the radial mass distribution of the halo must allow a particle at the position and with the velocity of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy to reach the distance of the furthest stream carbon stars. Thus, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream gives a very powerful means to constrain the mass distribution it resides in, that is, the dark halo. We present N-body experiments simulating this disruption process as a function of the distribution of mass in the Galactic halo. A likelihood analysis shows that, in the Galactocentric distance range 16 kpc<R<60 kpc, the dark halo is most likely almost spherical. We rule out, at high confidence levels, the possibility that the halo is significantly oblate, with isodensity contours of aspect qm<0.7. This result is quite unexpected and contests currently popular galaxy formation models.},

title = {The thick disc of the Galaxy: sequel of a merging event.},
abstract = {Accurate characterization of thick disc properties from recent kinematic and photometric surveys provides converging evidences that this intermediate population is a sequel of the violent heating of early disc populations by a merging satellite galaxy. The thick disc population is revisited under the light of new data in a number of galactic sample fields. Various thick disc hypotheses are fitted to observational data through a maximum likelihood technique. The resulting characteristics of the thick disc are the following: a scale height of 760+/-50pc, with a local density of 5.6+/-1% of the thin disc. The scale length is constrained to be 2.8+/-0.8kpc, well in agreement with the disc scale length (2.5+/-0.3kpc). The mean metallicity of the thick disc is found to be -0.7+/-0.2dex, with no significant metallicity gradients. These photometric constraints in combination with kinematic data give new constraints on the thick disc formation. We show that thick disc characteristics are hardly compatible with a top-down formation scenario but fully compatible with a violent merging event arising at the early thin disc life time as described by Quinn, Hernquist {\&} Fullagar (1993).},

abstract = {We use evolutionary calculations presented in a recent paper \cite[(Cassisi et al. 1997a:]{C97a} hereinafter Paper I) to predict B, V, I magnitudes for stars in galactic globulars. The effect of the adopted mixing length on stellar magnitudes and colors is discussed, showing that the uncertainty on such a theoretical parameter prevents the use of MS stars as bona fide theoretical standard candles. However, comparison with Hipparcos data for field subdwarfs discloses a substantial agreement between theory and observation. Present predictions concerning the magnitude of TO and of HB stars are compared with similar results appeared in the recent literature. We find that our predictions about the dependence on metallicity of ZAHB magnitudes appear in good agreement with observational constraints as recently discussed by \cite[Gratton et al. (1997c).]{G97c} We present and discuss a theoretical calibration of the difference in magnitude between HB and TO as evaluated with or without element sedimentation. The effect of a variation of the original helium content on the magnitude of MS, TO and HB stars is explored and discussed. Finally we use theoretical HB magnitudes to best fit the CM diagram of M 68 and M 5, taken as representative of metal poor and intermediate metallicity galactic globulars, deriving an age of 11 +/- 1.0 Gyr and 10 +/- 1.0 Gyr, respectively, for the adopted chemical compositions, plus an additional uncertainty of +/-1.4 Gyr if the uncertainty on the chemical composition is taken into account. This result is discussed on the basis of current evaluations concerning cluster ages and distance moduli.},

title = {Fashionably Late? Building up the Milky Way's Inner Halo},
abstract = {Using a sample of 248 metal-poor stars (RR Lyraes, red giants and RHB stars) which is remarkable for the accuracy of its 6-D kinematical data, we find a new component for the local halo which has an axial ratio c/a ~ 0.2, a similar flattening to the thick disk. It has a small prograde rotation but is supported by velocity anisotropy, and contains more intermediate-metallicity stars (with -1.5 < [Fe/H] < -1.0) than the rest of our sample. We suggest that this component was formed quite late, during or after the formation of the disk. It formed either from the gas that was accreted by the last major mergers experienced by the Galaxy, or by dynamical friction of massive infalling satellite(s) with the halo and possibly the stellar disk or thick disk. The remainder of the stars in our sample exhibit a clumpy distribution in energy and angular momentum, suggesting that the early, chaotic conditions under which the inner halo formed were not violent enough to erase the record of their origins. The clumpy structure suggests that a relatively small number of progenitors were responsible for building up the inner halo, in line with theoretical expectations. We find a difference in mean binding energy between the RR Lyrae variables and the red giants in our sample, suggesting that more of the RR Lyraes in the sample belong to the outer halo, and that the outer halo may be somewhat younger, as first suggested by Searle and Zinn (1978). We also find that the RR Lyrae mean rotation is more negative than the red giants, which is consistent with the recent result of Carollo et al.(2007) that the outer halo has a retrograde rotation and with the difference in kinematics seen between RR Lyraes and BHB stars by Kinman et al.(2007).},

abstract = {We used fully cosmological, high-resolution N-body + smooth particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations to follow the formation of disc galaxies with rotational velocities between 135 and 270kms-1 in a Λ cold dark matter (CDM) universe. The simulations include gas cooling, star formation, the effects of a uniform ultraviolet (UV) background and a physically motivated description of feedback from supernovae (SNe). The host dark matter haloes have a spin and last major merger redshift typical of galaxy-sized haloes as measured in recent large-scale N-body simulations. The simulated galaxies form rotationally supported discs with realistic exponential scalelengths and fall on both the I band and baryonic Tully-Fisher relations. An extended stellar disc forms inside the Milky Way (MW)-sized halo immediately after the last major merger. The combination of UV background and SN feedback drastically reduces the number of visible satellites orbiting inside a MW-sized halo, bringing it in fair agreement with observations. Our simulations predict that the average age of a primary galaxy's stellar population decreases with mass, because feedback delays star formation in less massive galaxies. Galaxies have stellar masses and current star formation rates as a function of total mass that are in good agreement with observational data. We discuss how both high mass and force resolution and a realistic description of star formation and feedback are important ingredients to match the observed properties of galaxies.},

title = {Dwarf Galaxies in 2010: Revealing Galaxy Formation's Threshold and  Testing the Nature of Dark Matter},
abstract = { Over the past five years, searches in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data have more than doubled the number of known dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and have revealed a population of ultra-faint galaxies with luminosities smaller than typical globular clusters, L ~ 1000 Lsun. These systems are the faintest, most dark matter dominated, and most metal poor galaxies in the universe. Completeness corrections suggest that we are poised on the edge of a vast discovery space in galaxy phenomenology, with hundreds more of these extreme galaxies to be discovered as future instruments hunt for the low-luminosity threshold of galaxy formation. Dark matter dominated dwarfs of this kind probe the small-scale power-spectrum, provide the most stringent limits on the phase-space packing of dark matter, and offer a particularly useful target for dark matter indirect detection experiments. Full use of dwarfs as dark matter laboratories will require synergy between deep, large-area photometric searches; spectroscopic and astrometric follow-up with next-generation optical telescopes; and subsequent observations with gamma-ray telescopes for dark matter indirect detection. },

title = {The Dwarf Satellites of M31 and the Galaxy},
abstract = {The satellite systems of M31 and the Galaxy are compared. It is noted that all five of the suspected stripped dSph cores of M31 companions are located within a projected distance of 40 kpc of from the nucleus of this galaxy, whereas the normal dSph companions to this object have distances > 40 kpc from the center of M31. All companions within 200 kpc < D(M31) < 600 kpc are late-type objects. The companions to the Galaxy appear to exhibit different systematics with the irregular LMC and SMC being located at small R_{gc}. It is speculated that this difference might be accounted for by assuming that the Magellanic Clouds are interlopers that were originally formed in the outer reaches of the Local Group. The radial distribution of the total sample of 40 companions of M31 and the Galaxy, which is shown in Figure 1, may hint at the possibility that these objects contain distinct populations of core (R < 25 kpc) and halo (R > 25 kpc) satellites.)},

title = {Two stellar components in the halo of the Milky Way},
abstract = {The halo of the Milky Way provides unique elemental abundance and kinematic information on the first objects to form in the Universe, and this information can be used to tightly constrain models of galaxy formation and evolution. Although the halo was once considered a single component, evidence for its dichotomy has slowly emerged in recent years from inspection of small samples of halo objects. Here we show that the halo is indeed clearly divisible into two broadly overlapping structural components-an inner and an outer halo-that exhibit different spatial density profiles, stellar orbits and stellar metallicities (abundances of elements heavier than helium). The inner halo has a modest net prograde rotation, whereas the outer halo exhibits a net retrograde rotation and a peak metallicity one-third that of the inner halo. These properties indicate that the individual halo components probably formed in fundamentally different ways, through successive dissipational (inner) and dissipationless (outer) mergers and tidal disruption of proto-Galactic clumps.},

title = {Robust variable star detection techniques suitable for automated searches - New results for NGC 1866},
abstract = {A technique for robust variable star detection suitable for automated searches is described, focusing on new results for Cepheid-bearing LMC cluster NGC 1866, and NGC 3201. Multiepoch photometry lists made either in two or more bandpasses, or pairwise in a single bandpass are applied. The correlation in brightness change between paired frames allows the extraction of information on variability in the presence of random photometric noise. A statistical method for determining the type of variable star or degree of contamination by an unresolved source, as well as a bootstrap method for predicting confidence intervals for detection of real variability, are described. The application of this technique to NGC 1866 has led to the discovery of 12 new Cepheid variables, and a determination of periods for all but one of the 23 NGC 1866 Cepheids. Also obtained is evidence for photometric contamination by unresolved companion stars, and the discovery of a RRab variable, as well as three longer-period red variables. Several main-sequence variable stars were detected.},

title = {Abundances of Actinides and Short-lived Nonactinides in the Interstellar Medium: Diverse Supernova Sources for the r-Processes},
abstract = {Abundances of 244Pu, 235U, 238U, and 232Th in the early solar system are about those expected for uniform production over most of galactic history. The inferred abundance of 182Hf is also compatible with this model. We here associate production of 182Hf with the same r-process SN sources that produce actinides (SNACS). This requires that r-process nucleosynthesis in SNACS took place rather uniformly over the age of the galaxy until ~107 yr prior to solar system formation. The low abundance of 107Pd and 129I in the early solar system indicates that SNACS cannot produce these nuclei at the high yields expected from standard r-process models. We propose that there are distinctive SN sources for different r-process nuclei with a sharp distinction in different SN contributions below and above A ~ 140. Abundances in stars with very low metallicities will vary depending on the type of SN contributing to the local region of star formation. A time scale of ~107 yr is much shorter than the 108 yr time usually associated with processes in the galaxy and with the last time of r-process injection accounting for 129I, but may be compatible with the rate of SN occurrence. The hypothesis of a nearby SN polluting the protosolar nebula is critically discussed.},

abstract = {We examine the outer Galactic H I disk for deviations from the b=0deg plane by constructing maps of disk surface density, mean height, and thickness. We find that the Galactic warp is well described by a vertical offset plus two Fourier modes of frequency m=1 and 2, all of which grow with galactocentric radius. Adding the m=2 mode accounts for the large asymmetry between the northern and southern warps. We use a Morlet wavelet transform to investigate the spatial and frequency localization of higher frequency modes; these modes are often referred to as ``scalloping.'' We find that the m=10 and 15 scalloping modes are well above the noise, but localized; this suggests that the scalloping does not pervade the whole disk, but only local regions.},

It is then argued that the ultimate goal of Galactic structure studies with Gaia astrometry should be to build a dynamical model of our galaxy which is capable of explaining the contents of the Gaia catalogue. This will be possible only by comparing predicted catalogue data to Gaia's actual measurements. To complement this approach the Gaia catalogue should be used to recalibrate photometric distance and abundance indicators across the HR-diagram in order to overcome the lack of precise parallax data at the faint end of the astrometric survey. Using complementary photometric and spectroscopic data from other surveys will be essential in this respect. },

title = {The luminosities of type II Cepheids and RR Lyrae variables},
abstract = {Recent work on the luminosities of type II Cepheids (CephIIs) and RR Lyrae variables is reviewed.In the near infrared (JHKs) the CephIIs in globular clusters show a narrow, linear, period-luminosity relation over their whole period range (about 1 to 100 days). The CephIIs in the general field of the LMC follow this relation for periods shorter than about 20 days. At longer period (the region of the RV Tau stars), the LMC field stars have a significant scatter and in the mean are more luminous than the PL relation. The OGLEIII optical data for the LMC field variables show similar trends. Infrared colours of stars in the RV Tau period range show marked mean differences between three groupings; the Galactic field, the LMC field, and globular clusters. In the case of the Galactic field, at least, this may be strongly influenced by selection effects. In the period range about 4 to 20 days (the W Vir range) there are stars lying above the PL relation which may be recognized by their light curves and are all likely to be binaries. The bright Galactic variable, kappa Pav probably belongs to this group. There is evidence that CephIIs in the general field (LMC and Galaxy) have a wider range of masses than those in globular clusters. At present the CephII PL zero-point depends on the pulsation parallaxes of two stars. Zero-points of RR Lyrae M(V)-[Fe/H] and Ks-log P relations can be obtained from trigonometrical, statistical and pulsation parallaxes. These zero-points are compared with those for CephIIs and with the classical Cepheid scale using variables of these three types in the LMC. Within the uncertainties (about 0.1mag) the various scales are in agreement.},

abstract = {We present the results of detailed N-body simulations of clusters moving in a realistic Milky Way (MW) potential. The strong interaction with the bulge and the disk of the Galaxy leads to the formation of tidal tails, emanating from opposite sides of the cluster. Some characteristic features in the morphology and orientation of these streams are recognized and intepreted. The tails have a complex morphology, in particular when the cluster approaches its apogalacticon, showing multiple ``arms'' in remarkable similarity to the structures observed around NGC 288 and Willman 1. Actually, the tails are generally good tracers of the cluster path quite far from the cluster center (>7--8 tidal radii), while on the smaller scale they are mainly pointing in the direction of the Galaxy center. In particular, the orientation of the inner part of the tails is highly correlated to the cluster orbital phase and to the local orbital angular acceleration. This implies that, in general, the orbital path cannot be estimated directly from the orientation of the tails, unless a sufficient large field around the cluster is available.},

The best-fit age for NGC 188 was determined to be 6.5+/-1.0 Gyr. The solar-metallicity Hipparcos field stars yielded a slightly older thin-disk age, 7.5+/-0.7 Gyr. Two slightly metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-0.22) field stars whose kinematic and orbital parameters indicate that they are members of the thin disk were found to have an age of 9.7+/-0.6 Gyr. The age for 47 Tuc was determined to be 12.5+/-1.5 Gyr. All errors are internal errors due to the uncertainty in the values of metallicity and reddening. Thus, the oldest stars dated in the thin disk are found to be 2.8+/-1.6 Gyr younger than 47 Tuc. Furthermore, as discussed by Chaboyer, Sarajedini, {\&} Armandroff, 47 Tuc has a similar age to three globular clusters located in the inner part of the Galactic halo, implying that star formation in the thin disk started within 2.8+/-1.6 Gyr of star formation in the halo.},

Two of the remaining 3 stars differ from one another by only 9 km/s, but it would be premature to identify them as a second system.},

title = {Extragalactic Thick Disks: Implications for Early Galaxy Evolution},
abstract = { I briefly review the growing evidence that thick stellar disks surround most edge-on disk galaxies. Recent studies show that these extragalactic thick disks have old ages, low metallicities, long scale lengths, and moderately flattened axial ratios, much like the thick disk of the Milky Way. However, the properties of thick disks change systematically with the mass of the galaxy. The thick disks of low mass galaxies are more prominent and somewhat more metal-poor than those surrounding massive disk galaxies. Given the strong evidence that thick disks are fossils from an early epoch of merging, these trends place tight constraints on the early assembly of disk galaxies. The data suggest that the vast majority of the accretion onto the early disk was gaseous, but that the majority of thick disk stars were directly accreted. },

title = {Hierarchical Triggering of Star Formation by Superbubbles in W3/W4},
abstract = {It is generally believed that expanding superbubbles and mechanical feedback from massive stars trigger star formation, because there are numerous examples of superbubbles showing secondary star formation at their edges. However, while these systems show an age sequence, they do not provide strong evidence of a causal relationship. The W3/W4 Galactic star-forming complex suggests a three-generation hierarchy: the supergiant shell structures correspond to the oldest generation; these triggered the formation of IC 1795 in W3, the progenitor of a molecular superbubble; which in turn triggered the current star-forming episodes in the embedded regions W3-North, W3-Main, and W3-OH. We present UBV photometry and spectroscopic classifications for IC 1795, which show an age of 3 - 5 Myr. This age is intermediate between the reported 6 - 20 Myr age of the supergiant shell system, and the extremely young ages (10^4 - 10^5 yr) for the embedded knots of ultracompact HII regions, W3-North, W3-Main, and W3-OH. Thus, an age sequence is indeed confirmed for the entire W3/W4 hierarchical system. This therefore provides some of the first convincing evidence that superbubble action and mechanical feedback are indeed a triggering mechanism for star formation.},

abstract = {The frequency of Type I supernovae (SN I) in galaxies with unusual star-formation activity, as well as the large envelopes of SN I, is regarded as almost conclusive evidence that the precursors of SN I belong to a young stellar population. It is assumed that white dwarfs, SN I, and SN II represent the deaths of stars in the mutually exclusive mass ranges below 4 solar masses, from 4 to 6.5 solar masses, and above 6.5 solar masses, respectively. Consequences of tentative assumptions based partly on empirical evidence for iron production by SN I and carbon production by low-mass stars are tested against published stellar abundances. From a variety of models for chemical abundances, it is found that the relative abundances of primary elements are essentially functions of time, determined by progenitor stellar lifetimes, although the absolute abundance levels depend mainly on the model parameters.},

abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) mosaic camera and telescope have obtained five-band optical-wavelength imaging near the Galactic plane outside of the nominal survey boundaries. These additional data were obtained during commissioning and subsequent testing of the SDSS observing system, and they provide unique wide-area imaging data in regions of high obscuration and star formation, including numerous young stellar objects, Herbig-Haro objects, and young star clusters. Because these data are outside the survey regions in the Galactic caps, they are not part of the standard SDSS data releases. This paper presents imaging data for 832 square degrees of sky (including repeats), in the star-forming regions of Orion, Taurus, and Cygnus. About 470 deg2 are now released to the public, with the remainder to follow at the time of SDSS Data Release 4. The public data in Orion include the star-forming region NGC 2068/NGC 2071/HH 24 and a large part of Barnard's loop.},

title = {The formation of disk galaxies in computer simulations},
abstract = { The formation of disk galaxies is one of the most outstanding problems in modern astro- 
physics and cosmology. We review the progress made by numerical simulations carried out 
on large parallel supercomputers. These simulations model the formation of disk galaxies 
within the current structure formation paradigm in which the Universe is dominated by a 
cold dark matter component and a cosmological constant. We discuss how computer simu- 
lations have been an essential tool in advancing the field further over the last decade or so. 
Recent progress stems from a combination of increased resolution and improved treatment 
of the astrophysical processes modeled in the simulations, such as the phenomenological 
description of the interstellar medium and of the process of star formation. We argue that 
high mass and spatial resolution is a necessary condition in order to obtain large disks com- 
parable with observed spiral galaxies avoiding spurious dissipation of angular momentum. 
A realistic model of the star formation history. gas-to-stars ratio and the morphology of the 
stellar and gaseous component is instead controlled by the phenomenological description of 
the non-gravitational energy budget in the galaxy. This includes the energy injection by 
supernovae explosions as well as by accreting supermassive black holes at scales below the 
resolution. We continue by showing that simulations of gas collapse within cold dark matter 
halos including a phenomenological description of supernovae blast-waves allow to obtain 
stellar disks with nearly exponential surface density profiles as those observed in real disk 
galaxies, counteracting the tendency of gas collapsing in such halos to form cuspy baryonic 
profiles. However, the ab-initio formation of a realistic rotationally supported disk galaxy 
with a pure exponential disk in a fully cosmological simulation is still an open problem. 
We argue that the suppression of bulge formation is related to the physics of galaxy for- 
mation during the merger of the most massive protogalactic lumps at high redshift, where 
the reionization of the Universe likely plays a key role. A sufficiently high resolution during 
this early phase of galaxy formation is also crucial to avoid artificial angular momentum 
loss and spurious bulge formation. Finally, we discuss the role of mergers in disk formation, 
adiabatic halo contraction during the assembly of the disk, cold flows, thermal instability 
and other aspects of galaxy formation, focusing on their relevance to the puzzling origin of 
bulgeless galaxies.

title = {Models for Interstellar Extinction in the Galaxy},
abstract = {We present two models for the interstellar extinction in the Galaxy that are based on the hypothesis that the interstellar dust is well mixed with the gas, with a constant ratio (except for a small dependence of metallicity on the Galactic radius), and therefore that the extinction is proportional to the column density of the gas. In the first model we assume that the Galaxy is axisymmetric; the gas density in the disk is a function of the Galactic radius and of the distance perpendicular to the Galactic plane, and the extinction is proportional to the column density of the gas. In the second model we take into account the spiral structure of the Galaxy. In this case, instead of increasing almost linearly with distance, the extinction increases by steps each time a spiral arm is crossed, but only increases slowly in the interarm regions. The gas density distribution is obtained from the Berkeley and Parkes H I surveys and from the Columbia University CO survey. The IRAS 100 μm brightness distribution is also used as a tracer of the interstellar dust column density. The predictions of the models are compared with data taken from a number of catalogs that present color excess and distances for large samples of stars. Our models are useful for estimating distances of objects and color corrections for objects for which the distance can be estimated by some other method, and also for star counts and brightness models of the Galaxy, among other applications.},

The uncertainties related to the choice of the neutron-nucleus interaction potential and the prediction of the excitation spectrum in the residual nucleus are discussed. The allowed direct E1-type transitions to all the excited states predicted by a combinatorial model of nuclear level densities are calculated with the introduction of an average spectroscopic factor. The resulting direct contribution to the neutron capture rate is estimated for all the neutron-rich nuclei potentially involved in the r-process nucleosynthesis and compared with the statistical compound nucleus contribution. The total radiative capture cross section is approximated and used in parametric r-process calculations to study the impact of the direct capture mechanism on the r-process nucleosynthesis.},

title = {A Comparison of the Chemical Evolutionary Histories of the Galactic Thin Disk and Thick Disk Stellar Populations},
abstract = {We have studied 23 long-lived G dwarfs that belong to the thin disk and thick disk stellar populations. The stellar data and analyses are identical, reducing the chances for systematic errors in the comparisons of the chemical abundance patterns in the two populations. Abundances have been derived for 24 elements: O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu. We find that the behavior of [α/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] versus [Fe/H] are quite different for the two populations. As has long been known, the thin disk O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti ratios are enhanced relative to iron at the lowest metallicities and decline toward solar values as [Fe/H] rises above -1.0. For the thick disk, the decline in [α/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] does not begin at [Fe/H]=-1.0, but at -0.4. Other elements share this same behavior, including Sc, Co, and Zn, suggesting that at least in the chemical enrichment history of the thick disk, these elements were manufactured in similar-mass stars. The heavy s-process elements Ba, La, Ce, and Nd are overabundant in the thin disk stars relative to the thick disk stars. On the other hand, the constancy of the [Ba/Y] ratio suggests that only one s-process site was manufacturing these elements or, possibly, that the r-process was responsible for the bulk of the nucleosynthesis of these elements. We combine our results with other studies (Edvardsson et al., Prochaska et al., Bensby et al., and Reddy et al.), who had already found very similar trends, in order to further explore the origin of the thick disk. The signs for an independent (parent galaxy) evolution of the thick disk are clear, in terms of the different metallicities at which the [α/Fe] ratios begin to decline, as well as the ``step function'' behavior of some elements, including [Eu/Y], [Ba/Fe], and possibly [Cu/Fe], at [Fe/H]~-0.2.},

abstract = {We search for signatures of past accretion events in the Milky Way in the recently published catalogue by Nordstrom et al.(2004), containing accurate spatial and kinematic information as well as metallicities for 13240 nearby stars. To optimize our strategy, we use numerical simulations to characterize the properties of the debris from disrupted satellites. We find that stars with a common progenitor should show distinct correlations between their orbital parameters; in particular, between the apocentre A and pericentre P, as well as their z-angular momentum (L_z). In the APL-space, such stars are expected to cluster around regions of roughly constant eccentricity. The APL space for the Nordstrom catalogue exhibits a wealth of substructure, much of which can be linked to dynamical perturbations induced by spiral arms and the Galactic bar. However, our analysis also reveals a statistically significant excess of stars on orbits of common (moderate) eccentricity, analogous to the pattern expected for merger debris. Besides being dynamically peculiar, the 274 stars in these substructures have very distinct metallicity and age distributions, providing further evidence of their extra-Galactic provenance. It is possible to identify among these stars, three coherent Groups with characteristic ages and metallicities, that, in all likelihood, correspond to the remains of disrupted satellites.

abstract = {The astrophysical nature of r-process sites is a long standing mystery and many probable sources have been suggested in the past, among them lower-mass core-collapse supernovae (in the range 8 - 10 Msol), higher-mass core-collapse supernovae (with masses > 20 Msol) and neutron star mergers. In this work, we present a detailed inhomogeneous chemical evolution study that considers for the first time neutron star mergers as major r-process sources, and compare this scenario to the ones in which core-collapse supernovae act as dominant r-process sites. We conclude that, due to the lack of reliable iron and r-process yields as function of progenitor mass, it is not possible at present to distinguish between the lower-mass and higher-mass supernovae scenarios within the framework of inhomogeneous chemical evolution. However, neutron-star mergers seem to be ruled out as the dominant r-process source, since their low rates of occurrence would lead to r-process enrichment that is not consistent with observations at very low metallicities. Additionally, the considerable injection of r-process material by a single neutron-star merger leads to a scatter in [r-process/Fe] ratios at later times which is much too large compared to observations.},

title = {The formation of disk galaxies in a LCDM universe},
abstract = {We study the formation of disk galaxies in a fully cosmological framework using adaptive mesh refinement simulations. We perform an extensive parameter study of the main sub-grid processes that control how gas is converted into stars and the coupled effect of supernovae feedback. We argue that previous attempts to form disk galaxies have been unsuccessful because of the universal adoption of strong feedback combined with high star formation efficiencies. Unless extreme amounts of energy are injected into the interstellar medium during supernovae events, these star formation parameters result in bulge dominated S0/Sa galaxies as star formation is too efficient at z~3. We show that a low efficiency of star-formation more closely models the sub-parsec physical processes, especially at high redshift. We highlight the successful formation of extended disk galaxies with scale lengths r_d=4-5 kpc, flat rotation curves and bulge to disk ratios of B/D~1/4. Not only do we resolve the formation of a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy, we also observe the secular evolution of the disk as it forms a pseudo-bulge. The disk properties agree well with observations and are compatible with the photometric and baryonic Tully-Fisher relations, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and the observed angular momentum content of spiral galaxies. We conclude that underlying small-scale star formation physics plays a larger role than previously considered in simulations of galaxy formation.},

title = {Elemental abundance trends in the metal-rich thin and thick disks},
abstract = {Thick disks are common in spiral and S0 galaxies and seem to be an inherent part of galaxy formation and evolution. Our own Milky Way is host to an old thick disk. The stars associated with this disk are enhanced in the alpha-elements as compared to similar stars present in the thin disk. The Milky Way thin disk also appears to be younger than the thick disk. Elemental abundance trends in stellar samples associated with the thin and the thick disks in the Milky Way are reviewed. Special attention is paid to how such samples are selected. Our current understanding of the elemental abundances and ages in the Milky Way thick and thin disks are summarised and discussed. The need for differential studies is stressed. Finally, formation scenarios for the thick disk are briefly discussed in the light of the current observational picture.},

abstract = {To determine the nature of the recently discovered, ringlike stellar structure at the Galactic anticenter, we have collected spectra of a set of presumed constituent M giants selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog. Radial velocities have been obtained for stars spanning ~100$\,^{\circ}$, exhibiting a trend in velocity with Galactic longitude and an estimated dispersion of σv=20+/-4 km s-1. A mean metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.4+/-0.3 measured for these stars combines with previous evidence from the literature to suggest a population with a significant metallicity spread. In addition, a curious alignment of at least four globular clusters of lower mean metallicity is noted to be spatially and kinematically consistent with this stellar distribution. We interpret the M giant sample position and velocity variation with Galactic longitude as suggestive of a satellite galaxy currently undergoing tidal disruption in a noncircular, prograde orbit about the Milky Way.},

title = {The Determination of Reddening from Intrinsic VR Colors of RR Lyrae Stars},
abstract = {New R-band observations of 21 local field RR Lyrae variable stars are used to explore the reliability of minimum light (V - R) colors as a tool for measuring interstellar reddening. For each star, R-band intensity mean magnitudes and light amplitudes are presented. Corresponding V-band light curves from the literature are supplemented with the new photometry, and (V - R) colors at minimum light are determined for a subset of these stars as well as for other stars in the literature. Two different definitions of minimum light color are examined, one which uses a Fourier decomposition to the V and R light curves to find (V - R) at minimum V-band light, (V - R) F min, and the other which uses the average color between the phase interval 0.5-0.8, (V - R)phi(0.5-0.8) min. From 31 stars with a wide range of metallicities and pulsation periods, the mean dereddened RR Lyrae color at minimum light is (V - R) F min,0 = 0.28 $\pm$ 0.02 mag and (V - R)phi(0.5-0.8) min,0 = 0.27 $\pm$ 0.02 mag. As was found by Guldenschuh et al. using (V - I) colors, any dependence of the star's minimum light color on metallicity or pulsation amplitude is too weak to be formally detected. We find that the intrinsic (V - R) of Galactic bulge RR Lyrae stars are similar to those found by their local counterparts and hence that bulge RR0 Lyrae stars do not have anomalous colors as compared to the local RR Lyrae stars.},

title = {Stellar Archaeology - Exploring the Universe with Metal-Poor Stars},
abstract = {The abundance patterns of the most metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo and small dwarf galaxies provide us with a wealth of information about the early Universe. In particular, these old survivors allow us to study the nature of the first stars and supernovae, the relevant nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the formation and evolution of the elements, early star- and galaxy formation processes, as well as the assembly process of the stellar halo from dwarf galaxies a long time ago. This review presents the current state of the field of "stellar archaeology" - the diverse use of metal-poor stars to explore the high-redshift Universe and its constituents. In particular, the conditions for early star formation are discussed, how these ultimately led to a chemical evolution, and what the role of the most iron-poor stars is for learning about Population III supernovae yields. Rapid neutron-capture signatures found in metal-poor stars can be used to obtain stellar ages, but also to constrain this complex nucleosynthesis process with observational measurements. Moreover, chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor stars in different types of dwarf galaxies can be used to infer details on the formation scenario of the halo. and the role of dwarf galaxies as Galactic building blocks. I conclude with an outlook as to where this field may be heading within the next decade. A table of ~1000 metal-poor stars and their abundances as collected from the literature is provided in electronic format.},

title = {The Role of Cold Flows in the Assembly of Galaxy Disks},
abstract = {We use high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to demonstrate that cold flow gas accretion, particularly along filaments, modifies the standard picture of gas accretion and cooling onto galaxy disks. In the standard picture, all gas is initially heated to the virial temperature of the galaxy as it enters the virial radius. Low mass galaxies are instead dominated by accretion of gas that stays well below the virial temperature, and even when a hot halo is able to develop in more massive galaxies there exist dense filaments that penetrate inside of the virial radius and deliver cold gas to the central galaxy. For galaxies up to ~L*, this cold accretion gas is responsible for the star formation in the disk at all times to the present. Even for galaxies at higher masses, cold flows dominate the growth of the disk at early times. Within this modified picture, galaxies are able to accrete a large mass of cold gas, with lower initial gas temperatures leading to shorter cooling times to reach the disk. Although star formation in the disk is mitigated by supernovae feedback, the short cooling times allow for the growth of stellar disks at higher redshifts than predicted by the standard model.},

abstract = {This paper explores the mapping between the observable properties of a stellar halo in phase and abundance space and the parent galaxy's accretion history in terms of the characteristic epoch of accretion and mass and orbits of progenitor objects. The study utilizes a suite of 11 stellar halo models constructed within the context of a standard ΛCDM cosmology. The results demonstrate that coordinate-space studies are sensitive to the recent (0-8 Gyr ago) merger histories of galaxies (this timescale corresponds to the last few percent to tens of percent of mass accretion for a Milky Way-type galaxy). Specifically, the frequency, sky coverage, and fraction of stars in substructures in the stellar halo as a function of surface brightness are indicators of the importance of recent merging and of the luminosity function of infalling dwarfs. The morphology of features serves as a guide to the orbital distribution of those dwarfs. Constraints on the earlier merger history (>8 Gyr ago) can be gleaned from the abundance patterns in halo stars: within our models, dramatic differences in the dominant epoch of accretion or luminosity function of progenitor objects leave clear signatures in the [α/Fe] and [Fe/H] distributions of the stellar halo; halos dominated by very early accretion have higher average [α/Fe], while those dominated by high-luminosity satellites have higher [Fe/H]. This insight can be applied to reconstruct much about the merger histories of nearby galaxies from current and future data sets.},

abstract = { We present resolved stellar photometry of 4 fields along the major axis of the M33 disk from images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The photometry provides a detailed census of the red clump in all fields and reaches the ancient main sequence in the outermost field. Through detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the percentage of the stellar mass formed prior to z=1 changes from 71 +/- 9% in the innermost field to 16 +/- 6% in the outermost field. The disk shows a clear trend of increasing scale-length with time, evolving from 1.0 +/- 0.1 kpc 10 Gyr ago to 1.8 +/- 0.1 kpc at times more recent than 5 Gyr ago, in agreement with analytical predictions for disk growth. Beyond the disk truncation radius, however, the stellar density profile steepens with time and the age gradient reverses, in agreement with recent simulations. The late and slow growth of the stellar disk may be due in part to the low mass of M33. },

abstract = {With the 1 m Schmidt telescope of the Llano del Hato Observatory and the QUEST CCD camera, 380 deg2 of the sky have been surveyed for RR Lyrae variables in a band 2.3d wide in declination (centered at δ=-1$\,^{\circ}$) and covering right ascensions from 4h1 to 6h1 and from 8h0 to 17h0. The bright limit (due to CCD saturation) and the faint limit are V~13.5 and ~19.7, respectively, which correspond to ~4 and ~60 kpc from the Sun. We present a catalog of the positions, amplitudes, mean magnitudes, periods, and light curves of the 498 RR Lyrae variables that have been identified in this region of the sky. The majority of these stars (86%) are new discoveries. The completeness of the survey has been estimated from simulations that model the periods and light curves of real RR Lyrae variables and take into account the pattern of epochs of observation. While the completeness of the survey varies with apparent magnitude and with position, almost everywhere in the surveyed region it is quite high (>80%) for the type ab RR Lyrae variables and between 30% and 90% for the low-amplitude type c variables.

title = {Galactic fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars. Period - amplitude diagram, metallicities and distribution},
abstract = {We have analysed 1455 fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars of the Galactic field, using the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) data. The sample covers 75% of the sky and contains objects in the close neighbourhood of the Sun, within 4 kpc distance. Unlike in the previous analysis of the close field RRab, we see a clear manifestation of the Oosterhoff groups on the period - amplitude diagram. The relation for Oosterhoff I type variables becomes strongly flattened at large V amplitudes, which was not observed for globular cluster RR Lyrae. We calculate photometric metallicities using two available methods: one of Jurcsik {\&} Kovacs (1996) and the other of Sandage (2004). We find significant discrepancies between results from both methods. Comparison with spectroscopic metallicities undoubtedly favors the method of Jurcsik {\&} Kovacs (1996). In addition, we notice that RRab of Oosterhoff II type might follow a different metallicity-period-phase relation than Oosterhoff I type variables. The spatial distribution of Galactic field RRab does not show any metallicity gradients with distance from the Galactic Center in either of the Oosterhoff groups. However, both the older, metal poor Oosterhoff II variables and the metal rich Oosterhoff I RRab become more concentrated to the Galactic plane with increasing metal content.},

title = {The Role of Dwarf Galaxies in Building Large Stellar Halos},
abstract = { The hierarchical theory of galaxy formation rests on the idea that smaller galactic structures merge to form the galaxies that we see today. The past decade has provided remarkable observational support for this scenario, driven in part by advances in spectroscopic instrumentation. Multi-object spectroscopy enabled the discovery of kinematically cold substructures around the Milky Way and M31 that are likely the debris of disrupting satellites. Improvements in high-resolution spectroscopy have produced key evidence that the abundance patterns of the Milky Way halo and its dwarf satellites can be explained by Galactic chemical evolution models based on hierarchical assembly.  These breakthroughs have depended almost entirely on observations of nearby stars in the Milky Way and luminous red giant stars in M31 and Local Group dwarf satellites. In the next decade, extremely large telescopes will allow observations far down the luminosity function in the known dwarf galaxies, and they will enable observations of individual stars far out in the Galactic halo. The chemical abundance census now available for the Milky Way will become possible for our nearest neighbor, M31. Velocity dispersion measurements now available in M31 will become possible for systems beyond the Local Group such as Sculptor and M81 Group galaxies. Detailed studies of a greater number of individual stars in a greater number of spiral galaxies and their satellites will test hierarchical assembly in new ways because dynamical and chemical evolution models predict different outcomes for halos of different masses in different environments. },

abstract = {By adopting a chemical evolution model for the Milky Way already reproducing the evolution of several chemical elements, we compare our theoretical results with accurate and new stellar data of neutron capture elements and we are able to impose strong constraints on the nucleosynthesis of the studied elements. We can suggest the stellar sites of production for each element. In particular, the r-process component of each element (if any) is produced in the mass range from 10 to 30 Msun, whereas the s-process component arises from stars in the range from 1 to 3 Msun. Using the same chemical evolution model, extended to different galactocentric distances, we obtain results on the radial gradients of the Milky Way. We compare the results of the model not only for the neutron capture elements but also for alpha-elements and iron peak elements with new data of Cepheids stars. We give a possible explanation to the considerable scatter of neutron capture elements observed in low metallicity stars in the solar vicinity, compared to the small star to star scatter observed for the alpha-elements. In fact, we have developed a stochastic chemical evolution model, in which the main assumption is a random formation of new stars, subject to the condition that the cumulative mass distribution follows a given initial mass function. With our model we are able to reproduce the different features of neutron capture elements and alpha-elements. Finally, we test the prescriptions for neutron capture elements also for the dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group. We predict that the chemical evolution of these elements in dwarf spheroidal galaxies is different from the evolution in the solar vicinity and indicates that dwarf spheroidal galaxies (we see nowadays) cannot be the building blocks of our Galaxy.},

abstract = {The Hungarian-made Automated Telescope Network (HATnet) is an ongoing project to detect transiting extrasolar planets using small-aperture (11 cm diameter) robotic telescopes. In this paper, we present the results from using image subtraction photometry to reduce a crowded stellar field observed with one of the HATnet telescopes (HAT-5). This field was chosen to overlap with the planned Kepler mission. We obtained I-band light curves for 98,000 objects in a 67 square degree field of view centered at J2000 (α,δ) = (19h44m00s0, +37$\,^{\circ}$32'00.0"), near the Galactic plane in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra. These observations include 788 exposures of 5 minutes' length over 30 days. For the brightest stars (I~8.0) we achieved a precision of 3.5 mmag, falling to 0.1 mag at the faint end (I~14). From these light curves we identify 1617 variable stars, of which 1439 are newly discovered. The fact that nearly 90% of the variables were previously undetected further demonstrates the vast number of variables yet to be discovered even among fairly bright stars in our Galaxy. We also discuss some of the most interesting cases. These include V1171 Cyg, a triple system with the inner two stars in a P=1.462 day period eclipsing orbit and the outer star a P=4.86 day Cepheid; HD 227269, an eccentric eclipsing system with a P=4.86 day period that also shows P=2.907 day pulsations; WW Cyg, a well-studied eclipsing binary; V482 Cyg, an R Coronae Borealis star; and V546 Cyg, a PV Telescopii variable. We also detect a number of small-amplitude variables, in some cases with full amplitude as low as 10 mmag.},

The survey covers 1675 deg2 along the ecliptic to a mean depth of V=19.5, i.e., a heliocentric distance of ~50 kpc for RR Lyrae stars. The survey reveals 2016 RR Lyrae candidates. Follow-up photometric monitoring of a subset of these candidates shows ~24% contamination by non-RR Lyrae variables. We derive a map of overdensity of RR Lyrae stars in the halo that reveals a series of structures coincident with the leading and trailing arms of debris from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. One of the regions of overdensity is found on the trailing arm, 200$\,^{\circ}$ from the main body of the Sagittarius dwarf at a distance of ~45 kpc. This distant detection of the stellar population of the outer trailing arm of Sagittarius offers a tight constraint on the motion of the dwarf galaxy. A distinctly separate region of overdensity is seen toward the Virgo overdensity.},

title = {A Two Micron All-Sky Survey View of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy. IV. Modeling the Sagittarius Tidal Tails},
abstract = {M giants recovered from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey have recently been used to map the position and velocity distributions of tidal debris from the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy around the entire Galaxy. We compare this data set to both test-particle orbits and N-body simulations of satellite destruction run within a variety of rigid Milky Way potentials, and we find that the mass of the Milky Way within 50 kpc of its center should be (3.8-5.6)×1011Msolar in order for any Sgr orbit to simultaneously fit the velocity gradient in the Sgr trailing debris and the apocenter of the Sgr leading debris. Orbital pole precession of young debris and leading debris velocities in regions corresponding to older debris provide contradictory evidence in favor of oblate/prolate Galactic halo potentials, respectively, leading us to conclude that the orbit of Sgr has evolved over the past few gigayears. In light of this discrepancy, we consider constraints from only the younger portions of the debris within three models of the flattening of the Galactic potential [q=0.90 (O), 1.0 (S), and 1.25 (P), i.e., oblate, spherical, and prolate] in our further N-body simulations. On the basis of the velocity dispersion and width along the trailing tidal stream, we estimate the current bound mass of Sgr to be MSgr=(2-5)×108Msolar independent of the form of the Galactic potential; this corresponds to a range of mass-to-light ratios (M/L)Sgr=14-36(M/L)solar for the Sgr core. Models with masses in this range best fit the apocenter of leading Sgr tidal debris when they orbit with a radial period of roughly 0.85 Gyr and have perigalactica and apogalactica of about 15 and 60 kpc, respectively. These distances scale with the assumed distance to the Sgr dwarf and the assumed depth of the Galactic potential. The density distribution of debris along the orbit in these models is consistent with the M giant observations, and debris at all orbital phases in which M giants are obviously present is younger (i.e., was lost more recently from the satellite) than the typical age of a Sgr M giant star.},

The results of these computations are used as input for the radiative transfer calculations. The properties of the UBVI light curves have been analyzed by means of standard Fourier decomposition and a detailed comparison to recent observations has been performed. As main results we find an good agreement with important observed RR Lyrae properties like pulsation amplitudes and Fourier parameters in B-, V-, and I-bands. Additionally from these synthetic colour light curves we derive linear transformation laws between amplitudes as well as Fourier parameters in the different passbands.},

The catalog covers SDSS stripe 82, which lies along the celestial equator in the southern Galactic hemisphere (22h24m < αJ2000.0 < 04h08m, -1.27$\,^{\circ}$ < δJ2000.0 < +1.27$\,^{\circ}$, ~290 deg2), and contains 34 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz system for 748,084 unresolved sources at high Galactic latitudes (b < -20$\,^{\circ}$) that were observed at least four times in each of the ugri bands (with a median of 10 observations obtained over ~6 yr). In each photometric bandpass we compute various low-order light-curve statistics, such as rms scatter, χ2 per degree of freedom, skewness, and minimum and maximum magnitude, and use them to select and study variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter than g = 20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g and r bands (at high Galactic latitudes). The majority (2 out of 3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2) quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the 0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for finding low-redshift quasars as the UV excess color selection (at high Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of light-curve skewness for quasars and find that it is centered on zero. We find that about one-fourth of the variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of light-curve skewness in the g - r versus u - g color-color diagram on the main stellar locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like behavior). Using over 600 RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to the expected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that it will obtain well-sampled, 2% accurate, multicolor light curves for ~2 million low-redshift quasars and discover at least 50 million variable stars.},

title = {Tracing Galaxy Formation with Stellar Halos. I. Methods},
abstract = {If the favored hierarchical cosmological model is correct, then the Milky Way system should have accreted ~100-200 luminous satellite galaxies in the past ~12 Gyr. We model this process using a hybrid semianalytic plus N-body approach that distinguishes explicitly between the evolution of light and dark matter in accreted satellites. This distinction is essential to our ability to produce a realistic stellar halo, with mass and density profile much like that of our own Galaxy, and a surviving satellite population that matches the observed number counts and structural parameter distributions of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Our accreted stellar halos have density profiles that typically drop off with radius faster than the dark matter and follow power laws at r>~30 kpc with ρ~r-α, α~=3-4. They are well fit by Hernquist profiles over the full radial range. We find that stellar halos are assembled from the inside out, with the majority of mass (~80%) coming from the ~15 most massive accretion events. The satellites that contribute to the stellar halo have median accretion times of ~9 Gyr in the past, while surviving satellite systems have median accretion times of ~5 Gyr in the past. This implies that stars associated with the inner halo should be quite different chemically from stars in surviving satellites and also from stars in the outer halo or those liberated in recent disruption events. We briefly discuss the expected spatial structure and phase-space structure for halos formed in this manner. Searches for this type of structure offer a direct test of whether cosmology is indeed hierarchical on small scales.},

abstract = {We present the first results of our analyses of selected RR Lyrae stars for which data have been obtained by the Kepler Mission. As expected, we find a significant fraction of the RRab stars to show the Blazhko effect, a still unexplained phenomenon that manifests itself as periodic amplitude and phase modulations of the light curve, on time scales of typically tens to hundreds of days. The long time span of the Kepler Mission of 3.5 yrs, and the unprecedentedly high precision of its data provide a unique opportunity for the study of RR Lyrae stars. Using data of a modulated star observed in the first roll as a showcase, we discuss the data, our analyses, findings, and their implications for our understanding of RR Lyrae stars and the Blazhko effect. With at least 40% of the RR Lyrae stars in our sample showing modulation, we confirm the high incidence rate that was only found in recent high-precision studies. Moreover, we report the occurrence of additional frequencies, beyond the main pulsation mode and its modulation components. Their half-integer ratio to the main frequency is reminiscent of a period doubling effect caused by resonances, observed for the first time in RR Lyrae stars.},

title = {Stellar Tidal Streams in Spiral Galaxies of the Local Volume: A Pilot Survey with Modest Aperture Telescopes},
abstract = {[Abridged] Within the hierarchical framework for galaxy formation, minor merging and tidal interactions are expected to shape large galaxies to the present day. As part of a pilot survey, we have carried out ultra deep, wide field imaging of several isolated spiral galaxies in the Local Volume with data taken at small (D= 0.1-0.5m) robotic telescopes that provide exquisite surface brightness sensitivity. Our observational effort has led to the discovery of six previously undetected giant stellar structures in the halos of these galaxies that are likely associated with debris from tidally disrupted satellites. In addition, we confirm and clarify several enormous stellar over-densities previously reported in the literature, but never before interpreted as tidal streams. Our collection of galaxies presents an assortment of tidal phenomena exhibiting strikingly diverse morphological characteristics. In addition to identifying great circle-like features that resemble the Sagittarius stream surrounding the Milky Way, our observations have uncovered enormous structures that extend tens of kiloparsecs into the halos of the central spiral. We have also found remote shells, giant clouds of debris extending out into the galactic halos, jet-like features emerging from galactic disks and large-scale,diffuse structures that are almost certainly related to the remnants of ancient, already thoroughly disrupted satellites. A comparison with available stellar halo evolution simulations set in a Lambda-Cold Dark Matter cosmology suggests that the extraordinary variety of stellar morphologies detected in our survey matches that seen in those simulations. This morphological similarity constitutes new, qualitative evidence that the hierarchical merging predicted by these theoretical models applies generally to normal, Milky Way-like disk galaxies in the Local Volume.},

title = {Modeling the disruption of the globular cluster Pal5 by Galactic tides},
abstract = {In order to understand the extended massive tidal tails of the globular cluster Pal5, its very low mass and velocity dispersion, and its size, which is much larger than the theoretical tidal radius, we performed more than 1000 N-body simulations. Tidal shocks at disk crossings near perigalacticon dominate the evolution of extended low-concentration clusters, resulting in massive tidal tails and often in a quick destruction of the cluster. The overlarge size of Pal5 can be explained as the result of an expansion following the heating induced by the last strong disk shock ~150Myr ago. The models can reproduce the low observed velocity dispersion and the relative fractions of stars in the tails and between the inner and outer parts of the tails. The tidal tails of Pal5 show substantial structure not seen in our simulations. We argue that this structure is probably caused by Galactic substructure, such as giant molecular clouds, spiral arms, and dark-matter clumps. Clusters initially larger than their theoretical tidal limit remain so, because, after being shocked, they settle into a new equilibrium near apogalacticon, where they are unaffected by the perigalactic tidal field. This implies that, contrary to previous wisdom, globular clusters on eccentric orbits may well remain super-tidally limited and hence vulnerable to strong disk shocks, which dominate their evolution until destruction. Our simulations unambiguously predict the destruction of Pal5 at its next disk crossing in \~110Myr. This corresponds to only 1% of the cluster lifetime, suggesting that many more similar systems could once have populated the inner parts of the Milky Way, but have been transformed into debris streams by the Galactic tidal field.

abstract = {We provide the first detailed study of the RR Lyrae period-luminosity (PL) relation in the ugriz bandpasses of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) filter system. We argue that tight, simple PL relations are not present in the SDSS filters, except for the redder bandpasses i and (especially) z. However, for all bandpasses, we show that by incorporating terms involving a (fairly reddening-independent) ``pseudocolor'' C0≡(u-g)0-(g-r)0, we can obtain tight (nonlinear) relations. We provide such theoretically calibrated relations in the present paper, which should be useful in deriving precise absolute magnitudes (hence distances) and intrinsic colors (hence reddening values) even to individual field RR Lyrae stars. For applications to cases in which photometry in all five passbands may not be available, we also provide simple (although less precise) average PL relations for the i and z bandpasses, which read asMz=0.839-1.295logP+0.211logZ andMi=0.908-1.035logP+0.220logZ. Similarly, simple period-color relations for (r-i)0, (g-r)0, and (u-z)0 are also provided.},

title = {Chemical Abundances and Kinematics in Globular Clusters and Local Group Dwarf Galaxies and Their Implications for Formation Theories of the Galactic Halo},
abstract = {We review Galactic halo formation theories and supporting evidence, in particular kinematics and detailed chemical abundances of stars in some relevant globular clusters as well as Local Group dwarf galaxies. Outer halo red HB clusters tend to have large eccentricities and inhabit the area populated by dwarf spheroidal stars, favoring an extraGalactic origin. Old globulars show the full range of eccentricities, while younger ones seem to have preferentially high eccentricities, again hinting at their extraGalactic origin. We compare detailed abundances of a variety of elements between the halo and all dwarf galaxies studied to date, including both dwarf spheroidals and irregulars. The salient feature is that halo abundances are essentially unique. In particular, the general alpha vs. [Fe/H] pattern of 12 of the 13 galaxies studied are similar to each other and very different from the Milky Way. Sagittarius appears to be the only possible exception. It appears very unlikely that a significant fraction of the metal-rich halo could have come from disrupted dwarf galaxies of low mass. However, at least some of the metal-poor halo may have come from typical dwarfs, and a portion of the intermediate metallicity halo may have come from very massive systems. The chemical differences between the dwarfs and the halo are due to a combination of a low star formation efficiency and a high galactic wind efficiency in the former. The formation problem may be solved if the majority of halo stars formed within a few, very massive satellites accreted very early. However, any such satellites must either be accreted MUCH earlier than postulated, before the onset of SNe Ia , or star formation must be prevented to occur in them until only shortly before they are accreted.},

abstract = {The star formation histories of Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies and more distant potential LG members are reviewed. Problems in defining the spatial extent of the LG and membership are briefly discussed. The morphological types found in the LG are presented, and it is suggested that we see continuous evolution from low-mass dwarf irregulars (dIrrs) to dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) in the LG. Star formation histories for LG dwarfs and nearby LG candidates are compiled using population boxes. No two dwarfs, irrespective of morphological type, show the same evolutionary history, and all vary widely in ages of their subpopulations and in their enrichment history. The lack of gas in dSphs and dEs may be explained by a new photoionization scenario. Old populations, often spatially very extended, may be a common property of dwarf galaxies, though their fractions can be very small. Almost all types of dwarf galaxies studied in detail so far show spatial variations in ages and abundances such as radial age/metallicity gradients. The observed star formation histories impose constraints on merger and accretion scenarios. Properties of the Milky Way dSphs are compared to the M31 dSphs and discussed in the framework of the ram pressure/tidal stripping scenario.

title = {Light curve analysis of Variable stars using Fourier coefficients and  Principal Component Analysis},
abstract = { We present an efficient and robust method of light curve analysis of variable stars. While several studies have successfully employed Fourier decomposition technique for the structural analysis of a variety of light curves, a few studies have performed a principal component analysis (PCA) by using Fourier components as inputs to reduce the dimensionality further. In this paper, we employ the PCA technique to a large database of RR Lyrae and Cepheid light curves directly and compare the results with those obtained by the Fourier decomposition technique. We show that the first few principal components (PCs) allow us to extract most of the information when the input matrix is an array of magnitudes at different epochs rather than the Fourier coefficients. The first few PCs are thus enough to reconstruct the original light curves, reducing the data dimensionality by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to the Fourier coefficients. The analysis enables us to separate out the modes of RR Lyrae stars and to look for previously known and suspected resonances of Cepheid variables. We also demonstrate that the PCA technique can be used to classify variables into different classes in an automated, unsupervised way, a feature that has immense potential for large databases of the future. },

abstract = {The predictions of various putative disk, halo configurations in the solar neighborhood are compared with the body of data from newly available kinematically and nonkinematically selected samples. It is argued that the continuous extended disk configuration, together with a kinematically decoupled halo, is better able to represent the available observational material than is a three-discrete-component model containing a thin disk, a thick disk, and a halo having parameters similar to those suggested in the literature. While both model types are capable of producing the observed overall abundance distributions and the dependence of kinematics on abundance for kinematically selected samples, the extended disk-halo configuration is found to be superior to the preferred thin disk-thick disk, halo configuration.},

title = {The Chemical Evolution of the Galaxy: The Two-Infall Model},
abstract = {We present a new chemical evolution model for the Galaxy that assumes two main infall episodes, for the formation of the halo-thick disk and thin disk, respectively. We do not try to take into account explicitly the evolution of the halo since our model is better suited for computing the evolution of the disk (thick plus thin), but we implicitly assume that the timescale for the formation of the halo was of the same order as the timescale for the formation of the thick disk. The formation of the thin disk is much longer than that of the thick disk, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin disk comes not only from the thick disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium. The timescale for the formation of the thin disk is assumed to be a function of Galactocentric distance, leading to an inside-out picture for the Galaxy's building. The model takes into account the most up-to-date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adopts a threshold in the star formation process, which naturally produces a hiatus in the star formation rate at the end of the thick-disk phase, as suggested by recent observations. The model results are compared with an extended set of observational constraints both for the solar neighborhood and for the whole disk. Among these constraints, the tightest is the metallicity distribution of the G-dwarf stars, for which new data are now available. Our model fits these new data very well. The model also predicts the evolution of the gas mass, the star formation rate, the supernova rates, and the abundances of 16 chemical elements as functions of time and Galactocentric distance. We show that, in order to reproduce most of these constraints, a timescale of <=1 Gyr for the (halo) thick disk and of 8 Gyr for the thin disk's formation in the solar vicinity are required. We predict that the radial abundance gradients in the inner regions of the disk (R < 1 R{\.o}) are steeper than in the outer regions, a result confirmed by recent abundance determinations, and that the inner gradients steepen during the Galactic lifetime. The importance and the advantages of assuming a threshold gas density for the onset of the star formation process are discussed.},

The availability of 2MASS information permits assembly of a cleaned version of this catalog, comprising likely blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars or blue stragglers in the color interval -0.2 <= (B-V)o <= +0.2, which are of particular interest for investigation of the structure, kinematics, and dynamics of the thick disk and inner halo of the Milky Way, the total mass and mass profile of the Galaxy, and as potential foreground/background objects in efforts to bracket distances to high velocity clouds of H I. A comparison of the stars classified as high-likelihood BHB candidates with previous classifications based on UBV photometry and medium-resolution spectroscopy indicates that this class contains 78% correct identifications.},

We present the first U, B, V, I photometry of the old open cluster Auner 1 and determine it to be ~3.25 Gyr old and to lie 8.9 kpc from the Sun. In the background of the cluster, at more than 9 kpc, we detect a young population most likely associated with the Norma-Cygnus spiral arm. Furthermore, we detect the signature of an older population and identify its turnoff and red giant branch. This population is found to have a mean age of 7 Gyr and a mean metallicity of Z=0.006. We reconstruct the geometry of the stellar distribution and argue that this older population, often associated with the CMa ``galaxy,'' in fact belongs to the warped old thin- and thick-disk components along this line of sight.},

title = {R-Process Abundances and Chronometers in Metal-Poor Stars},
abstract = {Rapid neutron-capture (i.e., r-process) nucleosynthesis calculations, employing internally consistent and physically realistic nuclear physics input (QRPA beta-decay rates and the ETFSI-Q nuclear mass model), have been made. These calculations are compared with ground-based and HST observations of neutron-capture elements in the metal poor halo stars CS 22892--052, HD 115444, HD 122563 and HD 126238. The elemental abundances in all four metal-poor stars are consistent with the solar r-process elemental distribution for the elements Z >/= 56. These results strongly suggest, at least for those elements, that the relative elemental r-process abundances have not changed over the history of the Galaxy. This further suggests that there is one r-process site in the Galaxy, at least for elements Z >/= 56. Employing the observed stellar abundances of stable elements, in conjunction with the solar r-process abundances to constrain the calculations, predictions for the zero decay-age abundances of the radioactive elements Th and U are made. We compare these (least-squares-fit ETFSI-Q) predictions with newly derived observational values in three very metal-poor halo stars: HD 115444, CS 22892--052 and HD 122563. Within the observational errors the observed ratio of [Th/Eu] is the same in both CS 22892--052 and HD 115444. Comparing with the theoretical ratio suggests an average age of these two very metal poor stars to be approximately 15.6 +/- 4.6 Gyr, consistent with earlier radioactive age estimates and recent globular and cosmological age estimates.},

title = {RR Lyrae Variable Star Distribution in the Galactic Halo},
abstract = {From the CCD/Transit Instrument (CTI) survey, we generated a list of 42 RR Lyrae variable stars, 34 of which were previously undiscovered (Wetterer et al. 1996, Al, 112, 742). The CTI survey is unique when compared to other surveys in that its survey area covers a large range of Galactic latitude and longitude in a single field. In this paper we use these RR Lyrae variable stars to examine their number density from 7 to 35 kpc from the Galactic center. The RR Lyrae number density was found to follow a R-3.34$\pm$O.11 power-law function when modeled as a spherically symmetric distribution and an α-3.76$\pm$0.13 power-law function when modeled as the ellipsoidal distribution of Preston et al. (1991, ApJ, 375, 121). We then combined the CTI results with that of other surveys to provide a more complete picture of the RR Lyrae number density throughout the Galactic halo (0.6-80 kpc). A spherically symmetric model for the RR Lyrae number density yields a R-3.024$\pm$0.077 power-law function, although better agreement between surveys is reached if the number density is modeled as an ellipsoidal distribution, which yields an α-3.530$\pm$0.077 power-law function. The wide range of number densities measured at the Sun's distance from the Galactic center (>10-3 for both the local number density as calculated from bright RR Lyrae stars and the CTI survey, to <1 kpc-3 for a fields in the Lick RR Lyrae Survey and the Palomar-Groningen Variable Star Survey), as well as the possible underdensity of RR Lyraes beyond 25 kpc, are also discussed.},

title = {A Model for Abundances in Metal-poor Stars},
abstract = {A model is presented that seeks to explain quantitatively the stellar abundances of r-process elements and other elements associated with the r-process sites. It is argued that the abundances of all these elements in stars with -3<~[Fe/H]<-1 can be explained by the contributions of three sources. The sources are the first generations of very massive (>~100 Msolar) stars that are formed from big bang debris and are distinct from Type II supernovae (SNe II) and two types of SNe II, the H and L events, which can occur only at [Fe/H]>~-3. The H events are of high frequency and produce dominantly heavy (A>130) r-elements but no Fe (presumably leaving behind black holes). The L events are of low frequency and produce Fe and dominantly light (A<~130) r-elements (essentially none above Ba). By using the observed abundances in two ultra-metal-poor stars and the solar r-abundances, the initial or prompt inventory of elements produced by the first generations of very massive stars and the yields of H and L events can be determined. The abundances of a large number of elements in a star can then be calculated from the model by using only the observed Eu and Fe abundances. To match the model results and the observational data for stars with -3<[Fe/H]<-1 requires that the solar r-abundances for Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba must be significantly increased from the standard values. No such changes appear to be required for all other elements. If the changes in the solar r-abundances for Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba are not permitted, the model fails at -3<[Fe/H]<-1 but still works at [Fe/H]~-3 for these four elements. By using the corrected solar r-abundances for these elements, good agreement is obtained between the model results and data over the range -3<[Fe/H]<-1. No evidence of s-process contributions is found in this region, but all the observational data in this region now show regular increases of Ba/Eu above the standard solar r-process value. Whether the solar r-components of Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba used here to obtain a fit to the stellar data can be reconciled with those obtained from solar abundances by subtracting the s-components calculated from models is not clear.},

abstract = { We present deep ACS images of 3 fields in the edge-on disk galaxy NGC 891, which extend from the plane of the disk to 12 kpc, and out to 25 kpc along the major axis. The photometry of individual stars reaches 2.5 magnitudes below the tip of the RGB. We use the astrophotometric catalogue to probe the stellar content and metallicity distribution across the thick disk and spheroid of NGC 891. The CMDs of thick disk and spheroid population are dominated by old RGB stars with a wide range of metallicities, from a metal-poor tail at [Fe/H] ~ -2.4 dex, up to about half-solar metallicity. The peak of the MDF of the thick disk is at -0.9 dex. The inner parts of the thick disk, within 14 kpc along the major axis show no vertical colour/metallicity gradient. In the outer parts, a mild vertical gradient of Delta(V-I)/Delta|Z| = 0.1 +/- 0.05 kpc^-1 is detected. This gradient is however accounted for by the mixing with the metal poor halo stars. No metallicity gradient along the major axis is present for thick disk stars, but strong variations of about 0.35 dex around the mean of [Fe/H] = -1.13 dex are found. The properties of the asymmetric MDFs of the thick disk stars show no significant changes in both the radial and the vertical directions. The stellar populations at solar cylinder-like distances show strikingly different properties from those of the Galaxy, suggesting that the accretion histories of both galaxies have been different. The spheroid population shows remarkably uniform stellar population properties. The median metallicity of the halo stellar population shows a shallow gradient from about -1.15 dex in the inner parts to -1.27 dex at 24 kpc distance from the centre. Similar to the thick disk stars, large variations around the mean relation are present. },

title = {The Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera survey of the Monoceros Ring: accretion origin or Galactic anomaly?},
abstract = {We present the results of a wide-field camera survey of the stars in the Monoceros Ring, thought to be an additional structure in the Milky Way of unknown origin. Lying roughly in the plane of the Milky Way, this may represent a unique equatorial accretion event which is contributing to the thick disc of the Galaxy. Alternatively, the Monoceros Ring may be a natural part of the disc formation process. With 10 pointings in symmetric pairs above and below the plane of the Galaxy, this survey spans 90$\,^{\circ}$ about the equator of the Milky Way. Signatures of the stream of stars were detected in three fields, (l, b) = (118$\,^{\circ}$, +16$\,^{\circ}$) and (150$\,^{\circ}$, +15$\,^{\circ}$) plus a more tentative detection at (150$\,^{\circ}$, -15$\,^{\circ}$). Galactocentric distance estimates to these structures gave ~17, ~17, and ~13 kpc, respectively. The Monoceros Ring seems to be present on both sides of the Galactic plane, in a form different from that of the Galactic warp, suggestive of a tidal origin with streams multiply wrapping the Galaxy. A new model of the stream has shown a strong coincidence with our results and has also provided the opportunity to make several more detections in fields in which the stream is less significant. The confirmed detection at (l, b) = (123$\,^{\circ}$, -19$\,^{\circ}$) at ~14, kpc from the Galactic Centre allows a re-examination revealing a tentative new detection with a Galactocentric distance of ~21 kpc. These detections also lie very close to the newly discovered structure in Triangulum-Andromedae hinting at a link between the two. The remaining six fields are apparently non-detections although in light of these new models, closer inspection reveals tentative structure. With the overdensity of M giant stars in Canis Major being claimed both as a progenitor to the Monoceros Ring and alternatively a manifestation of the Milky Way warp, much is still unknown concerning this structure and its connection to the Monoceros Ring. Further constraints are needed for the numerical simulations to adequately resolve the increasingly complex view of this structure.},

title = {SEGUE-2 and APOGEE: Revealing the History of the Milky Way},
abstract = { The history of the Milky Way is encoded in the spatial distributions, kinematics, and chemical enrichment patterns of its resolved stellar populations. SEGUE-2 and APOGEE, two of the four surveys that comprise SDSS-III (the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III), will map these distributions and enrichment patterns at optical and infrared wavelengths, respectively. Using the existing SDSS spectrographs, SEGUE-2 will obtain spectra of 140,000 stars in selected high-latitude fields to a magnitude limit r ~ 19.5, more than doubling the sample of distant halo stars observed in the SDSS-II survey SEGUE (the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration). With spectral resolution R ~ 2000 and typical S/N per pixel of 20-25, SEGUE and SEGUE-2 measure radial velocities with typical precision of 5-10 km/s and metallicities ([Fe/H]) with a typical external error of 0.25 dex. APOGEE (the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment) will use a new, 300-fiber H-band spectrograph (1.5-1.7 micron) to obtain high-resolution (R ~ 24,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ~ 100 per pixel) spectra of 100,000 red giant stars to a magnitude limit H ~ 12.5. Infrared spectroscopy penetrates the dust that obscures the inner Galaxy from our view, allowing APOGEE to carry out the first large, homogeneous spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations. APOGEE spectra will allow radial velocity measurements with < 0.5 km/s precision and abundance determinations (with ~ 0.1 dex precision) of 15 chemical elements for each program star, which can be used to reconstruct the history of star formation that produced these elements.

title = {Kinematics of Metal-poor Stars in the Galaxy. III. Formation of the Stellar Halo and Thick Disk as Revealed from a Large Sample of Nonkinematically Selected Stars},
abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the space motions of 1203 solar-neighborhood stars with metal abundances [Fe/H]<=-0.6, on the basis of a catalog, of metal-poor stars selected without kinematic bias recently revised and supplemented by Beers et al. This sample, having available proper motions, radial velocities, and distance estimates for stars with a wide range of metal abundances, is by far the largest such catalog to be assembled to date. We show that the stars in our sample with [Fe/H]<=-2.2, which likely represent a ``pure'' halo component, are characterized by a radially elongated velocity ellipsoid (σU,σV,σW)=(141+/-11, 106+/-9, 94+/-8) km s-1 and small prograde rotation <Vφ>=30 to 50 km s-1, consistent with previous analysis of this sample by Beers and Sommer-Larsen based on radial velocity information alone. In contrast to the previous analysis, we find a decrease in <Vφ> with increasing distance from the Galactic plane for stars that are likely to be members of the halo population (Δ<Vφ>/Δ|Z|=-52+/-6 km s-1 kpc-1), which may represent the signature of a dissipatively formed flattened inner halo. Unlike essentially all previous kinematically selected catalogs, the metal-poor stars in our sample exhibit a diverse distribution of orbital eccentricities, e, with no apparent correlation between [Fe/H] and e. This demonstrates, clearly and convincingly, that the evidence offered in 1962 by Eggen, Lynden-Bell, {\&} Sandage for a rapid collapse of the Galaxy, an apparent correlation between the orbital eccentricity of halo stars with metallicity, is basically the result of their proper-motion selection bias. However, even in our nonkinematically selected sample, we have identified a small concentration of high-e stars at [Fe/H]~-1.7, which may originate, in part, from infalling gas during the early formation of the Galaxy. We find no evidence for an additional thick disk component for stellar abundances [Fe/H]<=-2.2. The kinematics of the intermediate-abundance stars close to the Galactic plane are, in part, affected by the presence of a rapidly rotating thick disk component with <Vφ> ~=200 km s-1 (with a vertical velocity gradient on the order of Δ<Vφ>/Δ|Z|=-30+/-3 km s-1 kpc-1) and velocity ellipsoid (σU, σV, σW)=(46+/-4, 50+/-4, 35+/-3) km s-1. The fraction of low-metallicity stars in the solar neighborhood that are members of the thick disk population is estimated as ~10% for -2.2<[Fe/H]<=-1.7 and ~30% for -1.7<[Fe/H]<=-1. We obtain an estimate of the radial scale length of the metal-weak thick disk of 4.5+/-0.6 kpc. We also analyze the global kinematics of the stars constituting the halo component of the Galaxy. The outer part of the halo, which we take to be represented by local stars on orbits reaching more than 5 kpc from the Galactic plane, exhibits no systematic rotation. In particular, we show that previous suggestions of the presence of a ``counter-rotating high halo'' are not supported by our analysis. The density distribution of the outer halo is nearly spherical and exhibits a power-law profile that is accurately described as ρ~R-3.55+/-0.13. The inner part of the halo is characterized by a prograde rotation and a highly flattened density distribution. We find no distinct boundary between the inner and outer halo. We confirm the clumping in angular-momentum phase space of a small number of local metal-poor stars noted in 1999 by Helmi et al. We also identify an additional elongated feature in angular-momentum phase space extending from the clump to regions with high azimuthal rotation. The number of members in the detected clump is not significantly increased from that reported by Helmi et al., even though the total number of the sample stars we consider is almost triple that of the previous investigation. We conclude that the fraction of halo stars that may have arisen from the precursor object of this clump may be smaller than 10% of the present Galactic halo, as previously suggested. The implications of our results for the formation of the Galaxy are discussed, in particular in the context of the currently favored cold dark matter theory of hierarchical galaxy formation.},

title = {Constraining the Milky Way potential with a 6-D phase-space map of the GD-1 stellar stream},
abstract = {The narrow GD-1 stream of stars, spanning 60 deg on the sky at a distance of ~10 kpc from the Sun and ~15 kpc from the Galactic center, is presumed to be debris from a tidally disrupted star cluster that traces out a test-particle orbit in the Milky Way halo. We combine SDSS photometry, USNO-B astrometry, and SDSS and Calar Alto spectroscopy to construct a complete, empirical 6-dimensional phase-space map of the stream. We find that an eccentric orbit in a flattened isothermal potential describes this phase-space map well. Even after marginalizing over the stream orbital parameters and the distance from the Sun to the Galactic center, the orbital fit to GD-1 places strong constraints on the circular velocity at the Sun's radius V_c=224 \pm 13 km/s and total potential flattening q_\Phi=0.87^{+0.07}_{-0.04}. When we drop any informative priors on V_c the GD-1 constraint becomes V_c=228 \pm 18 km/s. Our 6-D map of GD-1 therefore yields the best current constraint on V_c and the only strong constraint on q_\Phi at Galactocentric radii near R~15 kpc. Much, if not all, of the total potential flattening may be attributed to the mass in the stellar disk, so the GD-1 constraints on the flattening of the halo itself are weak: q_{\Phi,halo}>0.89 at 90% confidence. The greatest uncertainty in the 6-D map and the orbital analysis stems from the photometric distances, which will be obviated by Gaia.},

title = {Beryllium abundances and star formation in the halo and in the thick  disk},
abstract = { [abridged] Beryllium is a pure product of cosmic ray spallation. This implies a relatively simple evolution in time of the beryllium abundance and suggests its use as a time-like observable. We study the evolution of Be in the early Galaxy and its dependence on kinematic and orbital parameters. We investigate the formation of the halo and the thick disk of the Galaxy and the use of Be as a cosmochronometer. Beryllium abundances are determined from high resolution, high signal to noise UVES spectra with spectrum synthesis in the largest sample of halo and thick disk stars analyzed to date. We present our observational results in various diagrams. 1) In a log(Be/H) vs [Fe/H] diagram we find a marginal statistical detection of a real scatter, above what expected from measurement errors, with a larger scatter among halo stars. The detection of the scatter is further supported by the existence of pairs of stars with identical atmospheric parameters and different Be abundances. 2) In an log(Be/H) vs [alpha/Fe] diagram, the halo stars separate into two components; one is consistent with predictions of evolutionary models, while the other has too high alpha and Be abundances and is chemically indistinguishable from thick disk stars. This suggests that the halo is not a single uniform population where a clear age-metallicity relation can be defined. 3) In diagrams of Rmin vs [alpha/Fe] and log(Be/H) the thick disk stars show a possible decrease of [alpha/Fe] with Rmin, whereas no dependence of Be with Rmin is seen. This anticorrelation suggests that the star formation rate was lower in the outer regions of the thick disc, pointing towards an inside-out formation. The lack of correlation for Be indicates that it is insensitive to the local conditions of star formation. },

abstract = {Although fundamental for astrophysics, the processes that produce massive stars are not well understood. Large distances, high extinction, and short timescales of critical evolutionary phases make observations of these processes challenging. Lacking good observational guidance, theoretical models have remained controversial. This review offers a basic description of the collapse of a massive molecular core and a critical discussion of the three competing concepts of massive star formation: - monolithic collapse in isolated cores - competitive accretion in a protocluster environment - stellar collisions and mergers in very dense systems We also review the observed outflows, multiplicity, and clustering properties of massive stars, the upper initial mass function and the upper mass limit. We conclude that high-mass star formation is not merely a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation with higher accretion rates, but partly a mechanism of its own, primarily owing to the role of stellar mass and radiation pressure in controlling the dynamics.},

They include four probable new dwarf galaxies-one each in the constellations of Coma Berenices, Canes Venatici, Leo, and Hercules-together with one unusually extended globular cluster, Segue 1. We provide distances, absolute magnitudes, half-light radii, and color-magnitude diagrams for all five satellites. The morphological features of the color-magnitude diagrams are generally well described by the ridge line of the old, metal-poor globular cluster M92. In the past two years, a total of 10 new Milky Way satellites with effective surface brightness μv>~28 mag arcsec-2 have been discovered in SDSS data. They are less luminous, more irregular, and apparently more metal-poor than the previously known nine Milky Way dwarf spheroidals. The relationship between these objects and other populations is discussed. We note that there is a paucity of objects with half-light radii between ~40 and ~100 pc.

title = {Stellar population synthesis at the resolution of 2003},
abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

title = {Pre-Main-Sequence Evolution in the Taurus-Auriga Molecular Cloud},
abstract = {This paper analyzes optical and infrared photometry of pre-main-sequence stars in the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud. More than half of the stars in our sample have excess near-infrared emission. The near-infrared excesses correlate very well with other measures of activity, such as Ho emission, ultraviolet excess emission, millimeter continuum emission, and the presence of reflection nebulae and molecular outflows. The infrared colors and the ratio of far-infrared to bolometric luminosity display a smooth progression from the most deeply embedded protostars to optically visible T Tauri stars. Infalling envelope models account for the colors of protostars; simple disk models similarly reproduce the colors of many T Tauri stars. Both the stellar birth line and a l05 yr isochrone provide a reasonable upper envelope to the luminosity distribution of optically visible stars in the H-R diagram. Only a few stars in the cloud have apparent ages exceeding 2- 3 × 106 yr, as derived from detailed stellar evolution calculations. The distribution of stars in the H-R diagram indicates that the cloud has formed stars at a roughly constant rate for the past 1-2 × 106 yr. Analyses of the J and K-luminosity functions support this conclusion. Within the uncertainties, the observed mass distribution for optically visible stars agrees with a Miller-Scalo initial mass function. Source statistics imply a lifetime of 1-2 × l05 yr for the typical protostar in Taurus-Auriga. There is no evidence, however, that these sources lie on the stellar birth line. Indeed, the protostellar luminosity function is essentially identical to the luminosity function derived for optically visible T Tauri stars in the cloud. These results provide some support for the evolutionary sequence-embedded protostar → T Tauri star with a circumstellar disk → T Tauri star without a circumstellar disk-currently envisioned in standard models of low-mass star formation. Source statistics and infrared color-color diagrams demonstrate that pre-main-sequence stars develop bluer colors and display less evidence for circumstellar material with time. The data show little evidence, however, for the luminosity evolution expected along the proposed evolutionary sequence. Time-dependent accretion during the infall phase may account for the low luminosity of Taurus-Auriga protostars; this hypothesis requires more tests. },

title = {Four New Stellar Debris Streams in the Galactic Halo},
abstract = {We report on the detection of four new stellar debris streams and a new dwarf galaxy candidate in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Three of the streams, ranging between 3 and 15 kpc in distance and spanning between 37 and 84 degrees on the sky, are very narrow and are most probably tidal streams originating in extant or disrupted globular clusters. The fourth stream is much broader, roughly 45 kpc distant, at least 53 degrees in length, and is most likely the tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy. As the streams each span multiple constellations, we extend tradition and designate them the Acheron, Cocytos, Lethe, and Styx streams. At the same distance and apparently embedded in the Styx stream is a ~1 kpc-wide concentration of stars with a similar color-magnitude distribution which we designate Bootes III. Given its very low surface density, its location within the stream, and its apparently disturbed morphology, we argue that Bootes III may be the progenitor of Styx and in possibly the final throes of tidal dissolution. While the current data do not permit strong constraints, preliminary orbit estimates for the streams do not point to any likely progenitors among the known globular clusters and dwarf galaxies.},

We have created a synthetic {\it Gaia} Solar Neighbourhood catalogue by convolving the 6D phase-space coordinates of stellar particles from our disrupted satellites with the latest estimates of the {\it Gaia} measurement errors, and included realistic background contamination due to the Galactic disc(s) and bulge. We find that, even after accounting for the expected observational errors, the resulting phase-space is full of substructure. We are able to successfully isolate roughly 50% of the different satellites contributing to the `Solar Neighbourhood' by applying the Mean-Shift clustering algorithm in energy-angular momentum space. Furthermore, a Fourier analysis of the space of orbital frequencies allows us to obtain accurate estimates of time since accretion for approximately 30% of the recovered satellites.},

Because the metal abundances of the variables are constant or nearly so for a large range of periods (the Oosterhoff I variables with log P values in the range -0.29 to -0.215), a flat section in the M_v,[Fe-H] relation is produced that tends to reduce the slope if stars with log[Fe/H]<-1.5 are included in the solution. An analysis of data on RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic bulge yields a slope of ~0.31.},

There is strong observational support for the hierarchical assembly of galaxies, but by definition the dwarf galaxies we see today are not the same as the dwarf galaxies and proto-galaxies that were disrupted during the assembly. Our only insight into those disrupted building blocks comes from sifting through the resolved field populations of the surviving giant galaxies to reconstruct the star formation history, chemical evolution, and kinematics of their various structures. To obtain the detailed distribution of stellar ages and metallicities over the entire life of a galaxy, one needs multi-band photometry reaching solar-luminosity main sequence stars. The Hubble Space Telescope can obtain such data in the outskirts of Local Group galaxies. To perform these essential studies for a fair sample of the Local Universe will require observational capabilities that allow us to extend the study of resolved stellar populations to much larger galaxy samples that span the full range of galaxy morphologies, while also enabling the study of the more crowded regions of relatively nearby galaxies. With such capabilities in hand, we will reveal the detailed history of star formation and chemical evolution in the universe. },

abstract = { We present a structural analysis of NGC891, an edge-on galaxy that has long been considered to be an analogue of the Milky Way. Using starcounts derived from deep HST/ACS images, we detect the presence of a thick disk component in this galaxy with vertical scale height 1.44+/-0.03 kpc and radial scale length 4.8+/-0.1 kpc, only slightly longer than that of the thin disk. A stellar spheroid with a de Vaucouleurs-like profile is detected from a radial distance of 0.5 kpc to the edge of the survey at 25 kpc; the structure appears to become more flattened with distance, reaching q = 0.50 in the outermost halo region probed. The halo inside of 15 kpc is moderately metal-rich (median [Fe/H] ~ -1.1) and approximately uniform in median metallicity. Beyond that distance a modest chemical gradient is detected, with the median reaching [Fe/H] ~ -1.3 at 20 kpc. We find evidence for subtle, but very significant, small-scale variations in the median colour and density over the halo survey area. We argue that the colour variations are unlikely to be due to internal extinction or foreground extinction, and reflect instead variations in the stellar metallicity. Their presence suggests a startling conclusion: that the halo of this galaxy is composed of a large number of incompletely-mixed sub-populations, testifying to its origin in a deluge of small accretions. },

title = {On the formation of extended galactic disks by tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies},
abstract = {We explore the possibility that extended disks, such as that recently discovered in M31, are the result of a single dwarf (10^9--10^10 Msun) satellite merger. We carry out N-body simulations of dwarf NFW halos with embedded spheriodal stellar components on co-planar, prograde orbits in a M31-like host galaxy. As the orbit decays due to dynamical friction and the system is disrupted, the stellar particles form an extended, exponential disk-like structure that spans the radial range 30--200 kpc once they have relaxed. The disk scale-length correlates with the initial extent of the stellar component within the satellite halo: the more embedded the stars, the smaller the resulting disk scale-length. If the progenitors start on circular orbits, the kinematics of the stars that make up the extended disk have an average rotational motion that is 30--50 km/s lower than the host's circular velocity. For dwarf galaxies moving on highly eccentric orbits (e=0.7), the stellar debris exhibits a much lower rotational velocity. Our results imply that extended galactic disks might be a generic feature of the hierarchical formation of spiral galaxies such as M31 and the Milky Way.},

abstract = {Synthetic models of the horizontal branches in globular clusters are constructed from a grid of the standard horizontal branch evolutionary tracks. The models are used to study the period shifts at constant T(eff) between RR Lyrae variables in globular clusters of different metallicities and the variation in horizontal-branch luminosity with the Fe/H ratio. The results suggest that the observed differences in the mean periods of the ab variables and the fraction of c-type variables between the two Oosterhoff groups are caused by a difference in the mean luminosity of the ab variables of about 0.18 bolometric mass and by the uneven distribution of variables across the instability strip in the group II clusters.},

title = {Initial conditions for disc galaxies},
abstract = {We present a general recipe for constructing N-body realizations of galaxies comprised of near-spherical and disc components. First, an exact spherical distribution function for the spheroids (halo {\&} bulge) is determined, such that it is in equilibrium with the gravitational monopole of the disc components. Second, an N-body realisation of this model is adapted to the full disc potential by growing the latter adiabatically from its monopole. Finally, the disc is sampled with particles drawn from an appropriate distribution function, avoiding local-Maxwellian approximations. We performed test simulations and find that the halo and bulge radial density profile very closely match their target model, while they become slightly oblate due to the added disc gravity. Our findings suggest that vertical thickening of the initially thin disc is caused predominantly by spiral and bar instabilities, which also result in a radial re-distribution of matter, rather than scattering off interloping massive halo particles.},

title = {Exploring the Sagittarius Stream with SEKBO Survey RR Lyrae Stars},
abstract = {A sample of RR Lyrae (RRL) variables from the Southern Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt Object survey in regions overlapping the expected position of debris from the interaction of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy with the Milky Way (RA ~ 20 and 21.5 h; distance 16-21 kpc) has been followed up spectroscopically and photometrically. The 21 photometrically confirmed type ab RRLs have mean [Fe/H] = -1.79 +/- 0.08, consistent with the abundances found for RRLs in a different portion of the Sgr tidal debris stream. The distribution of velocities in the Galactic standard of rest frame (V_GSR) of the 26 RRLs in the region is not consistent with a smooth halo population. Upon comparison with the Sgr disruption models of Law et al (2005), a prominent group of five stars having highly negative radial velocities (V_GSR ~ -175 kms-1) is consistent with predictions for old trailing debris when the Galactic halo is modeled as oblate. The observations also require that the recent trailing debris stream has a broader spread perpendicular to the Sgr plane than predicted by the models. We have also investigated the possible association of the Virgo Stellar Stream (VSS) with Sgr debris by comparing radial velocities for RRLs in the region with the same models, finding similarities in the velocity-position trends. As suggested by our earlier work, the stars in the VSS region with large negative V_GSR values are likely to be old leading Sgr debris, but we find that while old trailing Sgr debris may well make a contribution at positive V_GSR values, it is unlikely to fully account for the VSS feature. Overall we find that further modeling is needed, as trailing arm data generally favors oblate models while leading arm data favors prolate models, with no single potential fitting all the observed data.},

title = {Stellar Kinematic Constraints on Galactic Structure Models Revisited: Bar and Spiral Arm Resonances},
abstract = {We study the phase space available to the local stellar distribution using a Galactic potential consistent with several recent observational constraints. We find that the induced phase space structure has several observable consequences. The spiral arm contribution to the kinematic structure in the solar neighborhood may be as important as the one produced by the Galactic bar. We suggest that some of the stellar kinematic groups in the solar neighborhood, like the Hercules structure and the kinematic branches, can be created by the dynamical resonances of self-gravitating spiral arms and not exclusively by the Galactic bar. A structure coincident with the Arcturus kinematic group is developed when a hot stellar disk population is considered, which introduces a new perspective on the interpretation of its extragalactic origin. A bar-related resonant mechanism can modify this kinematic structure.We show that particles in the dark matter disk-like structure predicted by recent LCDM galaxy formation experiments, with similar kinematics to the thick disk, are affected by the same resonances, developing phase space structures or dark kinematic groups that are independent of the Galaxy assembly history and substructure abundance. We discuss the possibility of using the stellar phase space groups as constraints to non-axisymmetric models of the Milky Way structure.},

We combined analyses of color-color diagrams with a new comparison of the hydrogen Balmer line profile to the reddening-free Q parameter to improve the reddening and extinction estimates for this low-latitude, differentially reddened, area of the sky. Results of our stellar parameter analysis for B/A spectral type stars associated with the BP show that the majority of the stars have main-sequence surface gravities placing them at an average heliocentric distance of <D> = 6.0 $\pm$ 2.7 kpc. This distance is most consistent with membership in a warped Milky Way disk, and strongly suggests that the BP stars are not associated with the other stellar populations previously reported to make up the CMa. This result casts serious doubt on the proposed dwarf galaxy origin for the CMa.},

abstract = {We present CCD BVI photometry of the old open cluster Berkeley 29, located in the anticentre direction. Using the synthetic Colour - Magnitude Diagrams technique we estimate at the same time its age, reddening, distance, and approximate metallicity using three types of stellar evolutionary tracks. The best solutions give: age=3.4 or 3.7 Gyr, (m-M)_0 = 15.6 or 15.8 with E(B-V) = 0.13 or 0.10, and metallicity lower than solar (Z=0.006 or 0.004), depending on the adopted stellar models. Using these derived values, Be 29 turns out to be the most distant open cluster known, with Galactocentric distance R_GC= 21.4 to 22.6 kpc. Hence, Be 29 qualitatively follows both the age-metallicity relation and the metal abundance gradient typical of Galactic disc objects. The cluster position and radial velocity, however, appear to link Be 29 to the family of the Canis Major debris.},

These data allow a systematic study of the structure of the Galaxy at low latitudes, where the Low Latitude Stream resides. We apply colour-magnitude diagram fitting techniques to map the stellar (sub)structure in these regions, enabling the detection of overdensities with respect to smooth models. These detections can be used to distinguish between different models of the Low Latitude Stream, and help to shed light on the nature of the system.},

abstract = { A review of the development of the concept of dark matter is given. I begin the review with the description of the discovery of the mass paradox in our Galaxy and in clusters of galaxies. In mid 1970s the amount of observational data was sufficient to suggest the presence of a massive and invisible population around galaxies and in clusters of galaxies. The nature of the dark population was not clear at that time, but the hypotheses of stellar as well as of gaseous nature of the new population had serious difficulties. These difficulties disappeared when non-baryonic nature of dark matter was suggested in early 1980s. In addition to the presence of Dark Matter, recent observations suggest the presence of Dark Energy, which together with Dark Matter and ordinary baryonic matter makes the total matter/energy density of the Universe equal to the critical cosmological density. There are various hypothesis as for the nature of the dark matter particles, and generally some form of weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs) are strongly favored. Both Dark Matter and Dark Energy are the greatest challenges for modern physics since their nature is unknown. },

Our survey exploits SDSS's major strengths (multicolor photometry, depth, large-scale, and uniformity) by combining filter smoothing with limits in both magnitude and color space to search for low surface brightness galaxies and stellar counterparts to the compact high-velocity clouds out to the Milky Way's virial radius (~350 kpc). Our calculated detection limits for a purely old stellar population vary with galaxy size and distance between μV,0=26.7 and 30.1 mag arcsec-2. These limits will allow us to detect systems whose surface brightnesses are 0.5-3.9 mag arcsec-2 fainter than Sextans, the lowest surface brightness Local Group member known. Our survey not only is sensitive to lower surface brightness stellar populations than possible with previous Local Group surveys, but will also allow us to make an unbiased and well-defined assessment of the completeness of the observed Local Group galaxy luminosity function, so that we may compare the results with the predictions of various structure formation scenarios.},

title = {More Satellites of Spiral Galaxies},
abstract = {We present a revised and expanded catalog of satellite galaxies of a set of isolated spiral galaxies similar in luminosity to the Milky Way. This sample of 115 satellites, 69 of which were discovered in our multifiber redshift survey, is used to probe the results obtained from the original sample further (Zaritsky et al.). The satellites are, by definition, at projected separations <~500 kpc, have absolute recessional velocity differences with respect to the parent spiral of less than 500 km s-1, and are at least 2.2 mag fainter than their associated primary galaxy. A key characteristic of this survey is the strict isolation of these systems, which simplifies any dynamical analysis. We find no evidence for a decrease in the velocity dispersion of the satellite system as a function of radius out to galactocentric radii of 400 kpc, which suggests that the halo extends well beyond 200 kpc. Furthermore, the new sample affirms our previous conclusions (Zaritsky et al.) that (1) the velocity difference between a satellite and its primary is not strongly correlated with the rotation speed of the primary, (2) the system of satellites has a slight net rotation (34 +/- 14 km s-1) in the same sense as the primary's disk, and (3) that the halo mass of an ~L* spiral galaxy is in excess of 2 x 1012 M{\.o}.},

title = {Light curve analysis of Variable stars - is Principal Component Analysis a viable alternative to Fourier decomposition?},
abstract = {Context: We show the use of Principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition (FD) method as tools for variable star diagnostics. Aim: To compare the relative performance of the two methods (FD {\&} PCA) in revealing the changes in the light curve structures of pulsating Cepheids and in the classification of variable stars. Methods: We have calculated the Fourier parameters from the individual light curves of a variety of variables, e.g., RR Lyraes, Cepheids, Mira Variables and extrinsic variables. We have also applied PCA to this database of light curves. The inputs to the PCA are the 100 values of the magnitudes for each of the 17606 light curves in the database interpolated between phase 0 to 1. Results: We show that in general, the first few principal components (PC's) are enough to reconstruct the original light curves compared to FD method where 2 to 3 times more number of parameters are required to satisfactorily reconstruct the light curves. The computation of required number of Fourier parameters on the average needs 20 times more CPU time than the computation of required number of PC's. Therefore, PCA does have some advantage over the FD method in analysing the variable stars in a larger database. However in some cases, particularly in finding the resonances in Fundamental mode (FU) Cepheids, the PCA results show no distinct advantages over the FD method. We also demonstrate that the PCA technique can be used to classify variables into different variability classes in an automated, unsupervised way, a feature that has immense potential for larger databases of the future.},

Our sample contains 101 photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed giants with accurate distance, radial velocity and metallicity information. We have developed a new clustering estimator: the "4distance" measure, which when applied to our dataset leads to the identification of 1 group and 7 pairs of clumped stars. The group, with 6 members, can confidently be matched to tidal debris of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Two pairs match the properties of known Virgo structures. Using models of the disruption of Sagittarius in Galactic potentials with different degrees of dark halo flattening, we show that this favors a spherical or prolate halo shape, as demonstrated by Newberg et al. (2007) using SDSS data. One additional pair can be linked to older Sagittarius debris. We find that 20% of the stars in the Spaghetti dataset are in substructures. From comparison with random datasets we derive a very conservative lower limit of 10% to the amount of substructure in the halo. However, comparison to numerical simulations shows that our results are also consistent with a halo entirely built up from disrupted satellites, provided the dominating features are relatively broad due to early merging or relatively heavy progenitor satellites. },

abstract = {The discovery of the second highly {\$}r{\$}-process-enhanced, extremely metal-poor star, CS 31082-001 ([Fe/H] {\$}= -2.9{\$}) has provided a powerful new tool for age determination, by virtue of the detection and measurement of the radioactive species uranium and thorium. One of the serious limitations of this approach, however, is that predictions of the production ratio of U and Th have not been made in the context of a realistic astrophysical model of the {\$}r{\$}-process. We have endeavored to produce such a model, based on the ``neutrino winds'' that are expected to arise from the nascent neutron star of a core-collapse supernova. The mass-integrated {\$}r{\$}-process yields, obtained by assuming a simple time evolution of the neutrino luminosity, are compared to the available spectroscopic elemental abundance data of CS 31082-001. As a result, the ``age'' of this star is determined to be {\$}14.1 \pm 2.5{\$} Gyr, in excellent agreement with lower limits on the age of the universe estimated by other dating techniques, as well as with other stellar radioactive age estimates. Future measurements of Pt and Pb in this star, as well as expansion of searches for additional {\$}r{\$}-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars (especially those in which both U and Th are measurable), are of special importance to constrain the current astrophysical models for the {\$}r{\$}-process.},

Comparison of the density distribution at various epochs in simulations shows that in large low-density regions (voids) dynamical evolution is very slow and stops at an early epoch. In contrast, in large regions of higher density (superclusters) dynamical evolution starts early and continues until the present; here particles cluster early, and by merging of smaller groups very rich systems of galaxies form.},

title = {The Milky Way Tomography with SDSS: III. Stellar Kinematics},
abstract = {We study Milky Way kinematics using a sample of 18.8 million main-sequence stars with r<20 and proper-motion measurements derived from SDSS and POSS astrometry, including ~170,000 stars with radial-velocity measurements from the SDSS spectroscopic survey. Distances to stars are determined using a photometric parallax relation, covering a distance range from 100 pc to 10 kpc over a quarter of the sky at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>20 degrees). We find that in the region defined by 1 kpc <Z<5 kpc and 3 kpc <R< 13 kpc, the rotational velocity for disk stars smoothly decreases, and all three components of velocity dispersion increase, with distance from the Galactic plane. In contrast, the velocity ellipsoid for halo stars is aligned with a spherical coordinate system and is spatially invariant within the probed volume. The velocity distribution of nearby (Z<1 kpc) K/M stars is complex, and cannot be described by a standard Schwarzschild ellipsoid. For stars in a distance-limited subsample of stars (<100 pc), we detect a multimodal velocity distribution consistent with that seen by HIPPARCOS. This strong non-Gaussianity significantly affects the measurements of the velocity ellipsoid tilt and vertex deviation when using the Schwarzschild approximation. We develop and test a simple descriptive model for the overall kinematic behavior that captures these features over most of the probed volume, and can be used to search for substructure in kinematic and metallicity space. We use this model to predict further improvements in kinematic mapping of the Galaxy expected from Gaia and LSST.},

title = {Sinking Satellites and Tilting Disk Galaxies},
abstract = {We perform fully self-consistent N-body simulations of a system of disk, halo, and satellite to investigate three different dynamical responses of a disk to an infalling satellite: tilting, warping, and thickening. Our model is characterized by two cosmologically significant improvements. First, the satellites start at a distance more than 3 times the radius of the optical disk, which ensures a realistic interaction among the satellite, the disk, and the halo in the course of the satellite infall. Second, we allow evolution of the structure and velocity ellipsoid of the disk due to internal heating. We study the commonly arising case of low-density satellites in contrast to that of compact satellites considered in previous work. We find that disks are mainly tilted rather than heated by infalling satellites. Satellites of 10%, 20%, and 30% of the disk mass tilt the disk by angles of 2.dg9 +/- 0.dg3, 6.dg3 +/- 0.dg1, and 10.dg6 +/- 0.dg2. However, only 3.4%, 6.9%, and 11.1% of the orbital angular momentum is transferred to the parent galaxy. The kinetic energy associated with vertical motion in the initial coordinate frame of the disk is respectively increased by (6 +/- 3)%, (26 +/- 3)%, and (51 +/- 5)%, whereas the corresponding thermal energy associated with the vertical random motion in the tilted coordinate frame is only increased by (4 +/- 3)%, (6 +/- 2)%, and (10 +/- 2)%, respectively. The satellites cause warps that are substantially damped over 30 disk rotations. Given our choice of initial conditions, satellites are mainly accreted to the parent halos. Satellites having up to 20% of the disk mass produce no observable thickening, whereas a satellite with 30% of the disk mass produces little observable thickening inside the half-mass radius but great damage beyond this radius. Hence, high cosmological accretion and thin disks can coexist if most infalling satellites have densities comparable to that of the parent galaxy.},

abstract = {The well-established correlations between the mass of massive black holes (BHs) in the nuclei of most studied galaxies and various global properties of their hosting galaxy lend support to the idea that dwarf galaxies and globular clusters could also host a BH in their centers. Direct kinematic detection of BHs in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are seriously hindered by the small number of stars inside the gravitational influence region of the BH. The aim of this Letter is to establish an upper dynamical limit on the mass of the putative BH in the Ursa Minor (UMi) dSph galaxy. We present direct N-body simulations of the tidal disruption of the dynamical fossil observed in UMi, with and without a massive BH. We find that the observed substructure is incompatible with the presence of a massive BH of (2-3)x10^4 Msun within the core of UMi. These limits are consistent with the extrapolation of the M_{BH}-sigma relation to the M_{BH}<10^6 Msun regime. We also show that the BH may be off-center with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy.},

The models of Jaffe and Hernquist are included as special cases. The gravitational potential is analytical for all γ. For specific values of γ, most of the intrinsic and projected properties, such as distribution function, surface density and projected velocity dispersion, can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. A comparison to the de Vaucouleurs R^1/4^-profile shows that the model with γ = 3/2 most closely resembles it in both surface density and distribution function. This particular model is completely analytical, and thus it is the best analytical approximation of the R^1/4^-model known so far.},

We use numerical simulations to explore the evolution of debris from a tidally disrupted satellite, with the aim of developing a method that can be used to identify and quantify signatures of accretion in a survey of halo stars. For a Milky Way with a spherical halo, we find that debris from minor mergers can remain aligned along great circles throughout the lifetime of the Galaxy. We exploit this result to develop the method of great circle cell counts (GC3), which we test by applying it to artificially constructed halo distributions. Our results suggest that if as few as 1 % of the stars in a halo survey are accreted from the disruption of a single subsystem smaller than the Large Magellanic Cloud, GC3 can recover the great circle associated with this debris. The dispersion in GC3 can also be used to detect the presence of structure characteristic of accretion in distributions containing a much smaller percentage of material accreted from any single satellite.},

abstract = {We use data from the Northern Sky Variability Survey (NSVS), obtained from the first-generation Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE-I), to identify and study RR Lyrae variable stars in the solar neighborhood. We initially identified 1197 RRab (RR0) candidate stars brighter than the ROTSE median magnitude V=14. Periods, amplitudes, and mean V magnitudes are determined for a subset of 1188 RRab stars with well-defined light curves. Metallicities are determined for 589 stars by the Fourier parameter method and by the relationship between period, amplitude, and [Fe/H]. We comment on the difficulties of clearly classifying RRc (RR1) variables in the NSVS data set. Distances to the RRab stars are calculated using an adopted luminosity-metallicity relation with corrections for interstellar extinction. The 589 RRab stars in our final sample are used to study the properties of the RRab population within 5 kpc of the Sun. The Bailey diagram of period versus amplitude shows that the largest component of this sample belongs to Oosterhoff type I. Metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-1) RRab stars appear to be associated with the Galactic disk. Our metal-rich RRab sample may include a thin-disk, as well as a thick-disk population, although the uncertainties are too large to establish this. There is some evidence among the metal-rich RRab stars for a decline in scale height with increasing [Fe/H], as was found by Layden. The distribution of RRab stars with -1<[Fe/H]<-1.25 indicates that within this metallicity range the RRab stars are a mixture of stars belonging to halo and disk populations.},

title = {Episodic Star Formation in the Carina dSph Galaxy},
abstract = {We present photometry for stars in the Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy that is unprecedented in depth, accuracy and spatial coverage. Our data demonstrate that Carina has had a surprisingly complex evolution dominated by episodic bursts of star formation. Comparing the color-magnitude diagram with new theoretical isochrones, we determine that the ages of the ``bursts'' are approximately 2, 3--6, and 11--13 Gyr. Note that the ``bursts'' and quiescent phases lasted for <~1 Gyr, which are much longer than the ~0.1 Gyr dynamical timescale in the galaxy. Each main-sequence turnoff in Carina connects to a single red giant branch, which tells us that, regardless of age, Carina stars are metal-poor with [Fe/H]~= -1.86 and a spread in metal abundance of only 0.2 dex. Thus the process of star formation, and the loss of metal-enriched gas from supernovae-drive winds, in this low mass dwarf galaxy occurred episodically over many Gyr rather than in a single, brief episode.},

title = {A Canis Major Overdensity Imaging Survey. I. Stellar Content and Star-Count Maps: A Distinctly Elongated Body of Main-Sequence Stars},
abstract = {We present the first results from a large-area (~80deg×20deg), sparsely sampled, two-filter (B and R) imaging survey toward the Canis Major stellar overdensity, which is claimed to be a disrupting Milky Way satellite galaxy. Using stellar color-magnitude diagrams reaching to B~22 mag, we provide a first delineation of its surface density distribution using main-sequence stars. It is located below the Galactic midplane, and can be discerned to at least b=-15deg. Its projected shape is highly elongated, nearly parallel to the Galactic plane, with an axis ratio of at least 5:1, substantially more so than what Martin and coworkers originally found. We also provide a first map of a prominent overdensity of blue, presumably younger main-sequence stars, which extends in latitude to b~-10deg. We estimate an upper limit on the line-of-sight depth σlos of the old population based on the main-sequence width, obtaining σlos<1.8+/-0.3 kpc at an adopted Dsolar=7.5+/-1 kpc. For the young stellar population, we find σlos<1.5 kpc. The overall picture presented is one of a young stellar population that is less extended, both in terms of its line-of-sight depth and angular size, than the older population. While the data provide no firm arguments against an out-of-plane spiral arm interpretation, the data provide clear implications for others: (1) We infer from the strong elongation of the overdensity in longitude, and simulations in the literature, that the CMa overdensity is unlikely to be a gravitationally bound system at the present epoch, but may well be just a recently disrupted satellite remnant. The possible ``flattening'' of the young main-sequence population may, however, be a complexity for the satellite origin. (2) Based on modeling, the line-of-sight depth of the main-sequence overdensity in old stars is clearly inconsistent with published locally axisymmetric descriptions of the warped Galactic disk, such as those considered by Momany and coworkers. Without detailed modeling, the data set itself does not allow a distinction between interpretations as substructure in the warped outer Galactic disk or a disrupted satellite.},

Raw CCD images are prepared prior to analysis, and following the obtaining of an initial star list with the FIND program, synthetic aperture photometry is performed on the detected objects with the PHOT routine. A local sky brightness and a magnitude are computed for each star in each of the specified stellar apertures, and for crowded fields, the empirical point-spread function must then be obtained for each data frame. The GROUP routine divides the star list for a given frame into optimum subgroups, and then the NSTAR routine is used to obtain photometry for all the stars in the frame by means of least- squares profile fits. The process is illustrated with images of stars in a crowded field, and shortcomings and possible improvements of the program are considered.},

abstract = {As the core of a massive star collapses to form a neutron star, the flux of neutrinos in the overlying shells of heavy elements becomes so great that, despite the small cross section, substantial nuclear transmutation is induced. Neutrinos excite heavy elements and even helium to particle unbound levels. The evaporation of a single neutron or proton, and the back reaction of these nucleons on other species present, significantly alters the outcome of traditional nucleosynthesis calculations leading to a new process: nu-nucleosynthesis. Modifications to traditional hydrostatic and explosive varieties of helium, carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon burning are considered. The results show that a large number of rare isotopes, including many of the odd-Z nuclei from boron through copper, owe much of their present abundance in nature to this process.},

title = {The Progenitors of Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies},
abstract = {The gas-deficient dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies present an evolutionary puzzle that we explore in 40 early-type and late-type dwarfs in the Local Group and nearby field. Although dSph's experienced star formation over extended time spans in their youths, today all but one are completely free of detectable interstellar material, even in the Fornax dSph, where stars formed in the last 100 Myr. Combining photometric and spectroscopic stellar metallicity estimates for red giant branches with high-sensitivity H I 21 cm line data from the literature, we show that the well-established offset in luminosity-metallicity relationships for dSph's and dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies exists also when confining the comparison to their old stellar populations: dSph's have higher mean stellar metallicities for a fixed optical luminosity. Evidently star formation in younger dSph's was more vigorous than in the youthful dIrr's, leading to more efficient enrichment. Dwarf galaxies, whose locus in the luminosity-metallicity diagram is consistent with that of dSph's, even when baryonic luminosities are considered, are the ``transition-type dwarfs'' Phoenix, DDO 210, LGS 3, Antlia, and KKR 25. These dwarfs have mixed dIrr/dSph morphologies, low stellar masses, low angular momentum, and H I contents of at most a few 106 Msolar. Unlike dIrr's many transition-type dwarfs would closely resemble dSph's if their gas were removed, as required to become a dSph; they are likely dSph progenitors. As gas removal is the key factor for such a transition, we consider the empirical evidence in favor and against various gas removal processes. We suggest that internal gas removal mechanisms are inadequate and favor ram-pressure stripping to clean the bulk of interstellar matter from galaxies to make dSph's. A combination of initial conditions and environment seems to support the formation of dSph's: nearby dSph's appear to form from small galaxies with active early star formation, whose evolution halts due to externally induced gas loss. Transition-type dwarfs, then, are dSph's that kept their interstellar medium and therefore should replace dSph's in isolated locations where stripping is ineffective.},

abstract = {Stars in globular clusters are generally believed to have all formed at the same time, early in the Galaxy's history. 'Blue stragglers' are stars massive enough that they should have evolved into white dwarfs long ago. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for their formation: mass transfer between binary companions and stellar mergers resulting from direct collisions between two stars. Recently, the binary explanation was claimed to be dominant. Here we report that there are two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers in M30. This globular cluster is thought to have undergone 'core collapse', during which both the collision rate and the mass transfer activity in binary systems would have been enhanced. We suggest that the two observed sequences arise from the cluster core collapse, with the bluer population arising from direct stellar collisions and the redder one arising from the evolution of close binaries that are probably still experiencing an active phase of mass transfer.},

title = {Sub-structure of the outer Galactic Halo from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey},
abstract = { A pole-count analysis of the infrared 2MASS survey is presented, in order to identify faint stream-like structures within the halo of the Milky Way. Selecting stars with colours consistent with M-giant stars, we find a strong over-density of sources on a stream with pole (l=95,b=13), which corresponds to the pole of the orbit of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. This great-circle feature of width ~12 degrees, contains 5% of the late M-giants in the Halo. No other stream-like structures are detected in M-giants in the 2MASS Second Incremental Data Release (2IDR), and in particular, we find no evidence for a stellar component to the Magellanic Stream. This suggests that the present accretion rate of low-mass satellites with a luminous component is very low, and the formation of the luminous component of the Halo must have been essentially complete before the accretion of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, more than 3Gyr ago. We also search for great-circle streams using almost all high-latitude (|b|>30) sources in the 2IDR dataset. No narrow great-circle streams of width 0.5-2 degrees were found, though we were only sensitive to relatively nearby (<17kpc) remnants of massive (10^6 Msun) globular clusters. If the Galactic potential is close to being spherical, as some recent observations suggest, the lack of observed great-circle streams is consistent with the presence of dark matter substructures in the Halo. Although alternative explanations cannot be ruled out from our analysis of the 2IDR dataset, future experiments with better statistics have the potential to reveal the heating effect of dark matter substructure on stellar streams. },

We find a narrow (in apparent magnitude) main-sequence, extending 6 magnitudes below the turn-off to our limiting magnitude of B ~ 24.5 mag. This main sequence has very high constrast (>3) with respect to the thin/thick disk/halo background; its narrowness at brighter magnitudes clearly implies the presence of a distinct and possibly still bound stellar system. We derived the line-of-sight size (r_{1/2}) of this system based on the B-band width of the lower main sequence, obtaining 0.94 +/- 0.18 (random) +/- 0.18 (systematic) kpc. That size matches a model prediction for the main body of the parent galaxy of the Monoceros tidal stream. The high density contrast and limited spatial extent in the radial direction are very hard to reconcile with the alternative explanation put forward to explain the Canis Major stellar-overdensity: a flared or warped Galactic disk viewed in projection (Momamy et al. 2004). We also derived a central surface brightness of mu_{V,0}= 23.3 +/- 0.1 mag arcsec^{-2} and an absolute magnitude of M_{V}=-14.5 +/- 0.1 mag. These values place the Canis Major object in the category of dwarf galaxy in the the L_{V}--size and M_V - mu_{V} planes for such objects. However, like the Sagittarius dwarf, it is an outlier in the[Fe/H] -M_V plane in the sense that it is too metal rich for its estimated absolute magnitude. This suggests that the main mechanism driving its recent and current star formation history (possibly tidal stripping) is different to that of isolated dwarfs.},

abstract = {We present an accurate and robust method for the calculation of [Fe/H] from the light curves of RRab stars. The method introduces a considerable improvement relative to our previously published formulae. First of all, it uses an improved and extended data base for the light curves and more accurate, very recent iron abundances. Secondly, the new data base makes it possible to show that the basic relation between [Fe/H] and the Fourier parameters is linear and contains only the period and one of the Fourier phases, most importantly φ_31_. Last but not least, we derive interrelations among the Fourier parameters which help us to filter out peculiar stars where more caution is needed in accepting the calculated abundance. The applicability of the method is demonstrated on independent samples of globular cluster stars. Peculiarities encountered in Blazhko variables and in some other cases are also discussed.},

title = {Formation and dynamical evolution of galaxies and of their components},
abstract = {From this vast subject, I will pick out and review three specific topics, namely the formation and evolution of bars, the formation of bulges, and the evolution during multiple major mergers. Bars form naturally in galactic discs. Their evolution is driven by the exchange of angular momentum within the galaxy. This is emitted mainly by near-resonant material in the inner disc (bar), and is absorbed by near-resonant material in the outer disc and in the halo. As a result of this, the bar becomes stronger and rotates slower. Bulges are not a homogeneous class of objects. Based on their formation history, one can distinguish three types. Classical bulges are mainly formed before the actual disc component, from collapses or mergers and the corresponding dissipative processes. Boxy/peanut bulges are parts of bars seen edge-on. Finally, disc-like bulges are formed by the inflow of material to the center due to bar torques. Major mergers bring strong and fast evolution and can turn discs into ellipticals. I present results from simulations of multiple mergers in groups of disc or of elliptical galaxies and discuss the orbital anisotropy in the merger remnant.},

The resulting light curves are discussed and confronted with the observational data. Despite the fact that the 2:1 resonance with the second overtone dominates the dynamical behavior of the models, the Fourier phase Phi(21) exhibits a monotone, nearly featureless progression as the period ratio P2/P0 is varied. This progression is very different from the one displayed by the radial velocity curves. It is also dramatically different from the Phi(21) progression found in the classical Cepheid models. On the other hand, it is in a qualitative agreement with the observed behavior of the BL Her stars. Also, in contrast to the classical Cepheids, we find the remaining Fourier parameters of the models to be extremely sensitive to stellar mass and luminosity. It is shown that a small, observationally acceptable dispersion of M and L can account for a very large variety of shapes among the BL Her light curves.},

abstract = {We present the results of an Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) wide field camera survey of the stars in the Monoceros Ring (MRi) and purported Canis Major (CMa) overdensity in the Galactic longitudes of l = (193-276)$\,^{\circ}$. Current numerical simulations suggest that both of these structures are the result of a single on-going accretion event, although an alternative solution is that the warped and flared disc of the Galaxy can explain the origin of both of these structures. Our results show that, with regards the MRi, the warped and flared disc is unable to reproduce the locations and strengths of the detections observed around the Galaxy. This supports a non-Galactic origin for this structure. We report eight new detections and two tentative detections of the MRi in this survey. The exact nature of the CMa overdensity is still unresolved, although this survey provides evidence that invoking the Galactic warp is not a sufficient solution when compared with observation. Several fields in this survey are highly inconsistent with the current Galactic disc models that include a warp and flare, to such an extent that explaining their origins with these structures is problematic. We also report that the blue plume stars previously invoked to support the dwarf galaxy hypothesis are unfounded, and associating them with an outer spiral arm is equally problematic. Standard Galactic models are unable to accommodate all the observations of these new structures, leading away from a warped/flared disc explanation for their origins and more toward a non-Galactic source. Additionally, evidence is presented in favour of a detection of the CMa dwarf stream away from the CMa region. As the outer reaches of the Galactic disc continue to be probed, the fascinating structures that are the MRi and CMa overdensity will no doubt continue to inform us of the unique structure and formation of the Milky Way.},

abstract = {The recently emerging conviction that thick disks are prevalent in disk galaxies, and their seemingly ubiquitous old ages, means that the formation of the thick disk, perhaps more than any other component, holds the key to unravelling the evolution of the Milky Way, and indeed all disk galaxies. In Paper I, we proposed that the thick disk was formed in an epoch of gas-rich mergers at high redshift. This hypothesis was based on comparing N-body SPH simulations to a variety of Galactic and extragalactic observations, including stellar kinematics, ages, and chemical properties. Here we examine our thick-disk formation scenario in light of the most recent observations of extragalactic thick disks. In agreement, our simulated thick disks are old and relatively metal rich, with V-I colors that do not vary significantly with distance from the plane. Furthermore, we show that our proposal results in an enhancement of α-elements in thick-disk stars as compared with thin-disk stars, consistent with observations of the relevant populations of the Milky Way. We also find that our scenario naturally leads to the formation of an old, metal-weak, stellar halo population with high α-element abundances.},

title = {Simulations of minor mergers. II. The phase-space structure of thick  discs},
abstract = { We analyse the phase-space structure of simulated thick discs that are the result of a significant merger between a disc galaxy and a satellite. Our main goal is to establish what would be the characteristic imprints of a merger origin for the Galactic thick disc. We find that the spatial distribution predicted for thick disc stars is asymmetric, seemingly in agreement with recent observations of the Milky Way thick disc. Near the Sun, the accreted stars are expected to rotate more slowly, to have broad velocity distributions, and to occupy preferentially the wings of the line-of-sight velocity distributions. The majority of the stars in our model thick discs have low eccentricity orbits (in clear reference to the pre-existing heated disc) which gives rise to a characteristic (sinusoidal) pattern for their line of sight velocities as function of galactic longitude. The z-component of the angular momentum of thick disc stars provides a clear discriminant between stars from the pre-existing disc and those from the satellite, particularly at large radii. These results are robust against the particular choices of initial conditions made in our simulations, and thus provide clean tests of the disc heating via a minor merger scenario for the formation of thick discs. },

title = {Thin, thick and dark discs in LCDM},
abstract = {In a LCDM cosmology, the Milky Way accretes satellites into the stellar disc. We use cosmological simulations to assess the frequency of near disc plane and higher inclination accretion events, and collisionless simulations of satellite mergers to quantify the final state of the accreted material and the effect on the thin disc. On average, a Milky Way-sized galaxy has 1.5 subhalos with vmax>80km/s; 5 with vmax>60km/s; and 13 with vmax>40km/s merge at redshift z>1. A third of these merge at an impact angle <20 degrees and are dragged into the disc plane by dynamical friction. Their accreted stars and dark matter settle into a thick disc. The stellar thick disc qualitatively reproduces the observed thick disc at the solar neighbourhood, but is less massive by a factor ~2-10. The dark matter disc contributes 0.25 - 1 times the halo density at the solar position. Although not likely to be dynamically interesting, the dark disc has important implications for the direct detection of dark matter because of its low velocity with respect to the Earth. Higher inclination encounters (>20 degrees) are twice as likely as low inclination ones. These lead to structures that closely resemble the recently discovered inner/outer stellar halos. They also do more damage to the Milky Way stellar disc creating a more pronounced flare, and warp; both long-lived and consistent with current observations. The most massive mergers (vmax > 80km/s) heat the thin disc enough to produce a thick disc. These heated thin disc stars are essential for obtaining a thick disc as massive as that seen in the Milky Way; they likely comprise some 50-90% of the thick disc stars. The Milky Way thin disc must reform from fresh gas after z=1. [abridged]},

title = {Principal Component Analysis of RR Lyrae light curves},
abstract = { In this paper, we analyze the structure of RRab star light curves using Principal Component Analysis. We find this is a very efficient way to describe many aspects of RRab light curve structure: in many cases, a Principal Component fit with 9 parameters can describe a RRab light curve including bumps whereas a 17 parameter Fourier fit is needed. As a consequence we show statistically why the amplitude is also a good summary of the structure of a RR Lyrae light curve. We also use our analysis to derive an empirical relation relating absolute magnitude to light curve structure. In comparing this formula to those derived from exactly the same dataset but using Fourier parameters, we find that the Principal Component Analysis approach has disticnt advantages. These advantages are, firstly, that the errors on the coefficients in such formulae are smaller, and secondly, that the correlation between Principal Components is significantly smaller than the correlation between Fourier amplitudes. These two factors lead to reduced formal errors, in some cases estimated to be a factor of 2, on the eventual fitted value of the absolute magnitude. This technique will prove very useful in the analysis of data from existing large scale survey projects concerning variable stars. },

title = {Fishing in Tidal Streams: New Radial Velocity and Proper Motion Constraints on the Orbit of the Anticenter Stream},
abstract = {We have obtained radial velocity measurements for stars in two, widely-separated fields in the Anticenter Stream. Combined with SDSS/USNO-B proper motions, the new measurements allow us to establish that the stream is on a nearly circular, somewhat inclined, prograde orbit around the Galaxy. While the orbital eccentricity is similar to that previously determined for the Monoceros stream, the sizes, inclinations, and positions of the orbits for the two systems differ significantly. Integrating our best fitting Anticenter Stream orbit forward, we find that it is closely aligned along and lies almost on top of a stream-like feature previously designated the "Eastern Banded Structure". The position of this feature coincides with the apogalacticon of the orbit. We tentatively conclude that this feature is the next wrap of the Anticenter Stream.},

title = {RR Lyrae Pulsation Theory},
abstract = {RR Lyrae stars play an important role as distance indicators and stellar population tracers. In this context the construction of accurate pulsation models is crucial to understand the observed properties and to constrain the intrinsic stellar parameters of these pulsators. The physical mechanism driving pulsation in RR Lyrae stars has been known since the middle of the 20th century and many efforts have been performed during the last few decades in the construction of more and more refined pulsation models. In particular, nonlinear pulsation models including a nonlocal time-dependent treatment of convection, such as the ones originally developed in Los Alamos in the seventies, allow us to reproduce all the relevant observables of radial pulsation and to establish accurate relations and methods to constrain the intrinsic stellar properties and the distance of these variables. The most recent results on RR Lyrae pulsation obtained through these kinds of models will be presented and a few still debated problems will be discussed.},

abstract = { We use velocity and metallicity information from SDSS and SEGUE stellar spectroscopy to fit an orbit to the narrow {\$}63^\circ{\$} stellar stream of Grillmair and Dionatos.

Assuming a standard disk plus bulge and logarithmic halo potential for the Milky Way stars plus dark matter, the stream stars are moving with a large space velocity of approximately {\$}276 \rm km s^{-1}{\$} at perigalacticon.

title = {The Geneva-Copenhagen survey of the Solar neighbourhood II. New uvby calibrations and rediscussion of stellar ages, the G dwarf problem, age-metallicity diagram, and heating mechanisms of the disk},
abstract = {Context: Ages, metallicities, space velocities, and Galactic orbits of stars in the Solar neighbourhood are fundamental observational constraints on models of galactic disk evolution. Understanding and minimising systematic errors and sample selection biases in the data is crucial for their interpretation.  Aims: We aim to consolidate the calibrations of uvbyβ photometry into T_eff, [Fe/H], distance, and age for F and G stars and rediscuss the results of the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (Nordstr{\"o}m et al. 2004; GCS) in terms of the evolution of the disk.  Methods: We use recent V-K photometry, angular diameters, high-resolution spectroscopy, Hipparcos parallaxes, and extensive numerical simulations to re-examine and verify the temperature, metallicity, distance, and reddening calibrations for the uvbyβ system. We also highlight the selection effects inherent in the apparent-magnitude limited GCS sample.  Results: We substantially improve the T_eff and [Fe/H] calibrations for early F stars, where spectroscopic temperatures have large systematic errors. A slight offset of the GCS photometry and the non-standard helium abundance of the Hyades invalidate its use for checking metallicity or age scales; however, the distances, reddenings, metallicities, and age scale for GCS field stars require minor corrections only. Our recomputed ages are in excellent agreement with the independent determinations by Takeda et al. (2007), indicating that isochrone ages can now be reliably determined.  Conclusions: The revised G-dwarf metallicity distribution remains incompatible with closed-box models, and the age-metallicity relation for the thin disk remains almost flat, with large and real scatter at all ages (σ_intrinsic = 0.20 dex). Dynamical heating of the thin disk continues throughout its life; specific in-plane dynamical effects dominate the evolution of the U and V velocities, while the W velocities remain random at all ages. When assigning thick and thin-disk membership for stars from kinematic criteria, parameters for the oldest stars should be used to characterise the thin disk.

title = {Identification of A-colored Stars and Structure in the Halo of the Milky Way from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Commissioning Data},
abstract = {A sample of 4208 objects with magnitude 15<g*<22 and colors of main-sequence A stars have been selected from 370 deg2 of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning observations. The data is from two long, narrow stripes, each with an opening angle of greater than 60$\,^{\circ}$, at Galactic latitudes 36deg<|b|<63deg on the celestial equator. Relative photometric calibrations good to 2% and consistent absolute photometry allows this uniform sample to be treated statistically over the large area. An examination of the sample's distribution shows that these stars trace considerable substructure in the halo. Large overdensities of A-colored stars in the north at (l, b, R)=(350deg, 50$\,^{\circ}$, 46 kpc) and in the south at (157, -58, 33 kpc) and extending over tens of degrees are present in the halo of the Milky Way. Ivezic et al. have detected the northern structure from a sample of RR Lyrae stars in the SDSS. Using photometry to separate the stars by surface gravity, both structures are shown to contain a sequence of low surface gravity stars consistent with identification as a blue horizontal branch (BHB). Both structures also contain a population of high surface gravity stars 2 mag fainter than the BHB stars, consistent with their identification as blue stragglers (BSs). The majority of the high surface gravity stars in the Galactic halo may be BS stars like these. A population of F stars associated with the A star excess in the southern structure is detected (the F stars in the northern structure at 46 kpc would be too faint for the SDSS to detect). From the numbers of detected BHB stars, lower limits to the implied mass of the structures are 6×106 Msolar and 2×106 Msolar, although one does not yet know the full spatial extent of the structures. The fact that two such large clumps have been detected in a survey of only 1% of the sky indicates that such structures are not uncommon in the halo. Simple spheroidal parameters are fit to a complete sample of the remaining unclumped BHB stars and yield (at r<40 kpc) a fit to a halo distribution with flattening (c/a=0.65+/-0.2) and a density falloff exponent of α=-3.2+/-0.3. Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium.},

title = {A Calculation of the Mean Local RR Lyrae Space Density Using ROTSE},
abstract = {An RR Lyrae catalog containing 186 ab-type stars has been used to measure the local Galactic space density in regions 0.8-7.3 kpc from the Sun (4.5-10.7 kpc from the Galactic center). This catalog was taken from test fields in the ROTSE-I all-sky data covering ~5% of the sky. The mean density in a small region surrounding the Galactocentric radius of the Sun (7.1 kpc<Rg<8.1 kpc) was found to be ρ=4.6+/-0.4 kpc-3. A more local density was found using objects only within 1.5 kpc of the Sun (as opposed to just at the radius of the Sun). This local mean density was found to be ρ=5.8+/-0.7 kpc-3. The mean density with the distance above the Galactic plane, Z, was also measured in a region 0.2 kpc<Z<8.0 kpc. Fits to a simple exponential model of the thick disk show this distribution to be consistent with thick-disk scale heights of 0.58-1.5 kpc recently cited in the literature. Finally, the density using several other surveys of RR Lyrae stars in this region has been calculated and compared with the ROTSE data.},

title = {Structural Parameters of Thin and Thick Disks in Edge-on Disk Galaxies},
abstract = {We analyze the global structure of 34 late-type, edge-on, undisturbed, disk galaxies spanning a wide range of mass. We measure structural parameters for the galaxies using two-dimensional least-squares fitting to our R-band photometry. The fits require both a thick and a thin disk to adequately fit the data. The thick disks have larger scale heights and longer scale lengths than the embedded thin disks by factors of ~2 and ~1.25, respectively. The observed structural parameters agree well with the properties of thick and thin disks derived from star counts in the Milky Way and from resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies. We find that massive galaxies' luminosities are dominated by the thin disk. However, in low-mass galaxies (Vc<~120 km s-1) thick disk stars contribute nearly half the luminosity and dominate the stellar mass. Thus, although low-mass dwarf galaxies appear blue, the majority of their stars are probably quite old. Our data are most easily explained by a formation scenario in which the thick disk is assembled through direct accretion of stellar material from merging satellites while the thin disk is formed from accreted gas. The baryonic fraction in the thin disk therefore constrains the gas richness of the merging pregalactic fragments. If we include the mass in H I as part of the thin disk, the thick disk contains <~10% of the baryons in high-mass galaxies and ~25%-30% of the baryons in low-mass galaxies. Our data, therefore, indicate that the fragments were quite gas rich at the time of merging (fgas=75%-90%). However, because low-mass galaxies have a smaller fraction of baryons in their thin disks, the pregalactic fragments from which they assembled must have been systematically more gas poor. We believe this trend results from increased outflow due to supernova-driven winds in the lower mass pregalactic fragments. We estimate that ~60% of the total baryonic mass in these systems was lost due to outflows. Pushing the episode of significant winds to early times allows the mass-metallicity relationship for disks to be established early, before the main disk is assembled, and obviates the difficulty in driving winds from diffuse disks with low star formation efficiencies. We discuss other implications of this scenario for solving the G dwarf problem, for predicting abundance trends in thick disks, and for removing discrepancies between semianalytic galaxy formation models and the observed colors of low-mass galaxies.},

title = {Searching for spiral features in the outer Galactic disk. The field towards WR38 and WR38a},
abstract = {The detailed spiral structure in the outer Galactic disk is still poorly known, and for several Galactic directions we rely on model extrapolations. One of these regions is the fourth Galactic quadrant, in the sector comprised between Vela and Carina (270 <l< 300) where no spiral arms have been detected so far in the optical beyond 270. By means of deep UBVI photometry, we search for spiral features in known low absorption windows.U photometry, although demanding, constitutes a powerful tool to detect and characterize distant aggregates, and allows to derive firmer distance estimates. We studied a direction close to the tangent (l=290) to the Carina arm, in an attempt to detect optical spiral tracers beyond the Carina branch, where radio observations and models predictions indicate the presence of the extension of the Perseus and Norma-Cygnus spiral arms in the fourth quadrant.Along this line of sight, we detect three distinct groups of young stars. Two of them, at 2.5 and 6.0 kpc, belong to the Carina spiral arm (which is crossed twice in this particular direction).The latter is here detected for the first time. The third group, at a distance of 12.7 kpc, is part of the Perseus arm which lies beyond the Carina arm, and constitutes the first optical detection of this arm in the fourth Galactic quadrant. The position of this feature is compatible with HI observations and model predictions. We furthermore present evidence that this extremely distant group, formerly thought to be a star cluster (Shorlin 1), is in fact a diffuse young population. In addition, our data-set does not support the possible presence of the Monoceros Ring toward this direction. This study highlights how multicolor optical studies can be effective to probe the spiral structure in the outer Galactic disk.},

abstract = {We have performed a detailed study of the pulsational and evolutionary characteristics of 133 RR Lyrae stars in the globular cluster NGC 5272 (M3) using highly accurate BVI data taken on five separate epochs. M3 seems to contain no less than ~32% of Blazhko stars, and the occurrence and characteristics of the Blazhko effect have been analyzed in detail. We have identified a good number (~14%) of overluminous RR Lyrae stars that are likely in a more advanced evolutionary stage off the zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB). Physical parameters (i.e., temperature, luminosity, and mass) have been derived from B-V colors and accurate color-temperature calibration, and compared with horizontal-branch evolutionary models and with the requirements of stellar pulsation theory. Additional analysis by means of Fourier decomposition of the V light curves confirms, as expected, that no metallicity spread is present in M3. Evolution off the ZAHB does not affect [Fe/H] determinations, whereas Blazhko stars at low amplitude phase do affect [Fe/H] distributions, as they appear more metal-rich. Absolute magnitudes derived from Fourier coefficients might provide useful average estimates for groups of stars, if applicable, but do not give reliable individual values. Intrinsic colors derived from Fourier coefficients show significant discrepancies with the observed ones, and hence the resulting temperatures and temperature-related parameters are unreliable.},

Further, for RRc stars the parameters in the fit are all physical. Our study also reveals a number of additional periodicites in this data not found previously: we find 23 RRc stars, 29 RRab stars and 3 multiperiodic stars.},

title = {The assembly of galaxies in a hierarchically clustering universe},
abstract = {We study the formation of galaxies by using N-body/hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how baryons collect at the centre of dark matter haloes. We treat the dark matter as a collisionless fluid and the baryons as an ideal gas. We include the effects of gravity, pressure gradients, hydrodynamical shocks, and radiative energy losses, but we neglect star formation. Our initial conditions assume a flat universe dominated by cold dark matter with a mean baryon abundance of 10 per cent by mass. Typical haloes form through the merging of a few smaller systems which had themselves formed in a similar manner at higher redshift. The gas collects at the bottom of dark matter potential wells as soon as these are properly resolved by our simulations. There it settles into cold, tightly bound discs, and it remains cold during subsequent evolution. As their haloes coalesce, these discs merge on a time-scale that is consistent with dynamical friction estimates based on their total (gas+surrounding dark matter) mass. Both the merger rates of the discs and their mass spectrum are in remarkably good agreement with recent analytic models that describe the evolution of dark haloes in a hierarchical universe. This very simple model of galaxy formation suffers from serious shortcomings. It predicts that most baryons should be locked up in galaxies, whereas in the real universe most baryons are thought to lie outside visible galaxies. In addition, it predicts the specific angular momentum of a disc to be only about 20 per cent of that of its surrounding halo, corresponding to a radius smaller than that of observed spiral galaxy discs.},

title = {Sinking satellites and the heating of galaxy discs},
abstract = {We have carried out a set of self-consistent N-body simulations to study the interaction between disc galaxies and merging satellites with the aim of determining the disc kinematical changes induced by such events. We explore a region of the parameter space embracing satellites with different masses and internal structure and orbits of various eccentricities. We find that the analytic estimates of Toth {\&} Ostriker are high; overestimating the disc heating and thickening resulting from the accretion process by a factor of about 2-3. We find that the heating and thickening of the disc differ for satellites on prograde and retrograde orbits. The former tend to heat the stellar disc while the latter primarily produce a coherent tilt. For instance, a satellite of a Milky Way type galaxy with an initial mass of 20 per cent of that of the disc and on a retrograde orbit increases the velocity ellipsoid at the solar neighbourhood by (Delta sigma_R, Delta sigma_pi, Delta sigma_z)_solar ~ (11,9,6) km s^-1 and produces a maximum increment of the vertical scalelength and the stability parameter Q, inside the solar radius, of 300 pc and 0.8, respectively, increases of about 43 and 53 per cent. The same satellite, but on a prograde orbit, leads to changes of (Delta sigma_R, Delta sigma_pi , Delta sigma_z)_solar ~ (22,15,12) km s^-1, Delta z_o,solar ~ 550 pc and Delta Q_solar ~ 1.2. Thus, disc galaxies may accrete quite massive satellites without destroying the disc, particularly, if the orbits are retrograde. We also find that a massive bulge may play a role in reducing these effects. We have quantified the importance of the responsiveness of the halo by replacing it by a rigid potential in several simulations. In these cases, the increase of the vertical scalelength is larger by a factor of 1.5-2, indicating that a self-consistent treatment is essential for obtaining realistic results. A frequent by-product of the accretion process is the formation of weak stellar warps and asymmetric discs. Finally, we have checked how well Chandrasekhar's dynamical friction formula reproduces the sinking rates in several of our experiments. We find that it works well provided a suitable value is chosen for the Coulomb logarithm and the satellite mass is taken to be the mass still bound to the satellite at each moment.},

title = {Template K Light Curves for RR Lyrae Stars},
abstract = {We discuss a technique to compute using templates developed by fitting a Fourier series to existing high-quality K light curves of field RR Lyraes. We find that a series of order 2 is sufficient to model the light curves of first-overtone RRc variables, but 4 different 6th-order templates are needed for the fundamental RRab stars due to changes in the light curves that appear to correlate with the B amplitude. Applying the appropriate template to single-phase observations yield estimated values whose deviation from the true is randomly distributed over phase, and is of the same order of magnitude as the observational uncertainty, as long as the ephemeris phase is accurate. The addition of a second point, separated by at least 0.2 in phase from the first, allows the use of template-shifting to remove deviations that may arise from uncertainties in the ephemeris phase, and template and scaling factor selection, with final systematic errors reduced to less than 0.03 mag. We find that the use of templates yield superior results to those derived using other techniques, which can produce values that show systematic deviations over phase. (SECTION: Stars)},

For satellites with masses in the range 0.04-0.2 Mdisk on initially circular inclined prograde orbits merging with disks similar to the thin disk of the Galaxy, it is found that the dynamical coupling between disks and satellites leads to orbital decay. Disks respond to mergers by spreading both radially and vertically. The radial heating is driven largely by the spiral response of the dynamically cool disks to satellite perturbations.},

title = {The Globular Cluster System of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy},
abstract = {Prompted by the discovery of the accreted Canis Major dwarf galaxy and its associated globular cluster (GC) system, we investigate the contribution of accreted GCs to the Galactic system. The Canis Major GCs, and those associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, exhibit a range of Galactocentric radii, prograde and retrograde motions, and horizontal-branch morphologies, indicating that such properties are of limited use in identifying accreted GCs. In contrast, we find that the age-metallicity relation (AMR) of these dwarf galaxies is distinct from that of the main Galactic GC distribution at intermediate-to-high metallicities ([Fe/H]>~-1.3). The accretion of GCs with a distinct AMR would explain much of the apparent age spread in the Galactic GC system. The Canis Major and Sagittarius AMRs are similar to those of other Local Group dwarf galaxies and are consistent with a simple closed-box chemical enrichment model-a further indication that these GCs formed outside of the Milky Way. The Canis Major GCs all have smaller-than-average sizes for their Galactocentric distances, lending further support to their origin outside of the Milky Way. Our findings suggest that accretion of similar mass dwarfs does not appear to have played a major role in building the stellar mass of the thick disk or bulge of the Milky Way.},

title = {Gas-Rich Mergers in LCDM: Disk Survivability and the Baryonic Assembly  of Galaxies},
abstract = { We use N-body simulations and observationally-normalized relations between dark matter halo mass, stellar mass, and cold gas mass to derive robust, arguably inevitable expectations about the baryonic content of major mergers out to redshift z~2. First, we find that the majority of major mergers (m/M > 0.3) experienced by Milky Way size dark matter halos should have been gas-rich, and that gas-rich mergers are increasingly common at high redshift. Though the frequency of major mergers into galaxy halos in our simulations greatly exceeds the observed late-type galaxy fraction, the frequency of gas-poor major mergers is consistent with the observed fraction of spheroid-dominated galaxies across the halo mass range M_DM ~ 10^11-10^13 Msun. These results lend support to the conjecture that mergers with high baryonic gas fractions play an important role in building and/or preserving disk galaxies in the universe. Also, we find that the overall fraction of a galaxy's cold baryons deposited directly via major mergers is substantial. Approximately ~30% of the cold baryonic material in M_star ~ 10^10 Msun{\$} (M_DM ~ 10^11.5 Msun) galaxies is accreted as cold gas in major mergers. For more massive galaxies with M_star ~ 10^11 Msun (M_DM ~ 10^13 Msun) the fraction of baryons amassed in mergers is even higher, ~50%, but most of these accreted baryons are delivered directly in the form of stars. This baryonic mass deposition is almost unavoidable, and provides a limit on the fraction of a galaxy's cold baryons that can originate in cold flows or from hot halo cooling. (Abridged) },

abstract = {M giants selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) have been used to trace streams of tidal debris apparently associated with the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr) that entirely encircle the Galaxy. While the Sgr M giants are generally aligned with a single great circle on the sky, we measure a difference of 10.4d+/-2.6d between the mean orbital poles of the great circles that best fit debris leading and trailing Sgr, which can be attributed to the precession of Sgr's orbit over the range of phases explored by the data set. Simulations of the destruction of Sgr in potentials containing bulge, disk, and halo components best reproduce this level of precession along the same range of orbital phases if the potential contours of the halo are only slightly flattened, with the ratio of the axis length perpendicular to and in the disk in the range q=0.90-0.95 (corresponding to isodensity contours with qρ~0.83-0.92). Oblate halos are strongly preferred over prolate (qρ>1) halos, and flattenings in the potential of q<=0.85 (qρ<=0.75) and q>=1.05 (qρ>=1.1) are ruled out at the 3 σ level. More extreme values of q<=0.80 (qρ<=0.6) and q>=1.25 (qρ>=1.6) are ruled out at the 7 and 5 σ levels, respectively. These constraints will improve as debris with larger separation in orbital phases is found.},

title = {Our Milky Way as a Pure-Disk Galaxy - A Challenge for Galaxy Formation},
abstract = {Bulges are commonly believed to form in the dynamical violence of galaxy collisions and mergers. Here we model the stellar kinematics of the Bulge Radial Velocity Assay (BRAVA), and find no sign that the Milky Way contains a classical bulge formed by scrambling pre-existing disks of stars in major mergers. Rather, the bulge appears to be a bar, seen somewhat end-on, as hinted from its asymmetric boxy shape. We construct a simple but realistic N-body model of the Galaxy that self-consistently develops a bar. The bar immediately buckles and thickens in the vertical direction. As seen from the Sun, the result resembles the boxy bulge of our Galaxy. The model fits the BRAVA stellar kinematic data covering the whole bulge strikingly well with no need for a merger-made classical bulge. The bar in our best fit model has a half-length of ~ 4kpc and extends 20 degrees from the Sun-Galactic Center line. We use the new kinematic constraints to show that any classical bulge contribution cannot be larger than ~ 8% of the disk mass. Thus the Galactic bulge is a part of the disk and not a separate component made in a prior merger. Giant, pure-disk galaxies like our own present a major challenge to the standard picture in which galaxy formation is dominated by hierarchical clustering and galaxy mergers.},

title = {The QUEST RR Lyrae Survey. II. The Halo Overdensities in the First Catalog},
abstract = {The first catalog of the RR Lyrae stars (RRLSs) in the Galactic halo by the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team (QUEST) has been searched for significant overdensities that may be debris from disrupted dwarf galaxies or globular clusters. These RRLSs are contained in a band ~2.3d wide in declination that spans ~165$\,^{\circ}$ in right ascension and lie ~4 to ~60 kpc from the Sun. Away from the major overdensities, the distribution of these stars is adequately fitted by a smooth halo model, in which the flattening of the halo decreases with increasing galactocentric distance (as reported by Preston et al.). This model was used to estimate the ``background'' of RRLSs on which the halo overdensities are overlaid. A procedure was developed for recognizing groups of stars that constitute significant overdensities with respect to this background. To test this procedure, a Monte Carlo routine was used to make artificial RRLS surveys that follow the smooth halo model but with Poisson-distributed noise in the numbers of RRLSs and, within limits, random variations in the positions and magnitudes of the artificial stars. The 104 artificial surveys created by this routine were examined for significant groups in exactly the same way as the QUEST survey. These calculations provided estimates of the frequencies with which random fluctuations produce significant groups. In the QUEST survey there are six significant overdensities that contain six or more stars and several smaller ones. The small ones and possibly one or two of the larger ones may be artifacts of statistical fluctuations, and they need to be confirmed by measurements of radial velocity and/or proper motion. The most prominent groups are the northern stream from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy and a large group in Virgo, formerly known as the ``12.4 hr clump,'' which Duffau and coworkers have recently shown to contain a stellar stream (the Virgo stellar stream). Two other groups lie in the direction of the Monoceros stream and at approximately the right distance for membership. Another group is related to the globular cluster Palomar 5.},

title = {The Destruction of Thin Stellar Disks Via Cosmologically Common  Accretion Events},
abstract = { Most Galaxy-sized systems (M_host ~ 10^12 M_sun) in the LCDM cosmology are expected to have accreted at least one satellite with a total mass M_sat ~ 10^11 M_sun = 3M_disk in the past 8 Gyr. Analytic and numerical investigations suggest that this is the most precarious type of merger for the survival of thin galactic disks because more massive accretion events are relatively rare and less massive ones preserve thin disk components. We use high-resolution, dissipationless N-body simulations to study the response of an initially-thin, fully-formed Milky-Way type stellar disk to these cosmologically common events and show that the thin disk does not survive. Regardless of orbital configuration, the impacts transform the disks into structures that are roughly three times as thick and more than twice as kinematically hot as the observed dominant thin disk component of the Milky Way. We conclude that if the Galactic thin disk is a representative case, then the presence of a stabilizing gas component is the only recourse for explaining the preponderance of disk galaxies in an LCDM universe; otherwise, the disk of the Milky Way must be uncommonly cold and thin for its luminosity, perhaps as a consequence of an unusually quiescent accretion history. },

title = {The Selection of RR Lyrae Stars Using Single-Epoch Data},
abstract = {We use a complete sample of RR Lyrae stars discovered by the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team survey using light curves to design selection criteria based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) colors. Thanks to the sensitivity of the u-g color to surface gravity and of the g-r color to effective temperature and to the small photometric errors (~0.02 mag) delivered by SDSS, RR Lyrae stars can be efficiently and robustly recognized even with single-epoch data. In a 100% complete color-selected sample, the selection efficiency (the fraction of RR Lyrae stars in the candidate sample) is 6%, and, by adjusting color cuts, it can be increased to 10% with a completeness (the fraction of selected RR Lyrae stars) of 80% and to 60% with 28% completeness. Such color selection produces samples that are sufficiently clean for statistical studies of the Milky Way's halo substructure, and we use it to select 3,643 candidate RR Lyrae stars from SDSS Data Release 1. We demonstrate that this sample recovers known clumps of RR Lyrae stars associated with the Sgr dwarf tidal tail and the Palomar 5 globular cluster and use it to constrain the halo substructure away from the Sgr dwarf tidal tail. These results suggest that it will be possible to study the halo substructure out to ~70 kpc from the Galactic center in the entire area imaged by the SDSS, and not only in the multiply observed regions.},

abstract = {Minor accretion events with mass ratio M_sat : M_host ~ 1:10 are common in the context of LCDM cosmology. We use high-resolution simulations of Galaxy-analogue systems to show that these mergers can dynamically eject disk stars into a diffuse light component that resembles a stellar halo both spatially and kinematically. For a variety of orbital configurations, we find that ~5e8 M_sun of primary stellar disk material is ejected to a distance more than ~5 scale heights above the galactic plane. This ejected contribution is similar to the mass contributed by the tidal disruption of the satellite galaxy itself, though it is less extended. If we restrict our analysis to the approximate solar neighborhood in the disk plane, we find that ~1% of the initial disk stars in that region would be classified kinematically as halo stars. Our results suggest that the inner parts of galactic stellar halos contain ancient disk stars and that these stars may have been liberated in the very same events that delivered material to the outer stellar halo.},

title = {The core of the Canis Major galaxy as traced by Red Clump stars},
abstract = {The recently-discovered stellar system in Canis Major is analysed using He-burning Red Clump stars as tracers. We find that the main body of the system has an integrated absolute magnitude M_V=-14.1 +/- 0.9, a central surface brightness mu_{V,0}=24.0 +/- 0.7 and a line-of-sight profile peaked at D_{sun}=7.2 +/- 1.0 kpc with Half Width at Half Maximum ~2.0 kpc, in excellent agreement with the results obtained with widely different tracers (M giants and Main Sequence stars) in previous analyses. The mean distance to the main body of Canis Major is observed to increase with increasing Galactic longitude, from D_{sun} = 6.3 kpc at l = 225 deg, to D_{sun} = 9.3 kpc at l = 265 deg, in good agreement with the predictions of our more recent N-body simulation that models CMa as a dwarf galaxy being accreted in a planar orbit onto the disc of the Milky Way. We confirm that the Canis Major system has all the characteristics of the relic of a dwarf galaxy seen in front of a large-scale overdensity that we detect all over the region of Galaxy considered in this study (220 deg <= l<= 320 deg, with a strong maximum around l=290 deg and b>= -5 deg) that is identified as the stellar component of the Galactic Warp. We also address a recent claim that Canis Major is on the outskirts of a larger ``Argo'' structure centred at l = 290 deg. Our analysis shows that the stellar populations in the latter are distributed over a very large distance range along the line of sight, and do not give rise to a narrow peak in density in this direction, contrary to what is observed in Canis Major. This suggests that the Argo structure is likely due to Galactic asymmetries such as the Warp.},

This is evidence that the large-scale gravitational field causing the formation of rich clusters enhances the evolution of neighbouring poor systems, a phenomenon recently established in numerical simulations of group and cluster formation.},

Stripe 82 has been repeatedly monitored in the u, g, r, i and z bands over a seven-year baseline. Objects are cross-matched between runs, taking into account the effects of any proper motion. The resulting catalogue contains almost 4 million light-motion curves of stellar objects and galaxies. The photometry are recalibrated to correct for varying photometric zeropoints, achieving ~20 mmag and ~30 mmag root-mean-square (RMS) accuracy down to 18 mag in the g, r, i and z bands for point sources and extended sources, respectively. The astrometry are recalibrated to correct for inherent systematic errors in the SDSS astrometric solutions, achieving ~32 mas and ~35 mas RMS accuracy down to 18 mag for point sources and extended sources, respectively. For each light-motion curve, 229 photometric and astrometric quantities are derived and stored in a higher-level catalogue. On the photometric side, these include mean exponential and PSF magnitudes along with uncertainties, RMS scatter, chi^2 per degree of freedom, various magnitude distribution percentiles, object type (stellar or galaxy), and eclipse, Stetson and Vidrih variability indices. On the astrometric side, these quantities include mean positions, proper motions as well as their uncertainties and chi^2 per degree of freedom.

title = {Structure, Kinematics, and Chemical Enrichment Patterns after Major Gas-Rich Disc-Disc Mergers},
abstract = {We used an N-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics algorithm, with a detailed treatment of star formation, supernovae feedback, and chemical enrichment, to perform eight simulations of mergers between gas-rich disc galaxies. We vary the mass ratio of the progenitors, their rotation axes, and their orbital parameters and analyze the kinematic, structural, and chemical properties of the remnants. Six of these simulations result in the formation of a merger remnant with a disc morphology as a result of the large gas-fraction of the remnants. We show that stars formed during the merger (a sudden starburst occur in our simulation and last for 0.2-0.3 Gyr) and those formed after the merger have different kinematical and chemical properties. The first ones are located in thick disc or the halo. They are partially supported by velocity dispersion and have high [alpha/Fe] ratios even at metallicities as high as [Fe/H]=-0.5. The former ones - the young component - are located in a thin disc rotationally supported and have lower [alpha/Fe] ratios. The difference in the rotational support of both components results in the rotation of the thick disc lagging that of the thin disc by as much as a factor of two, as recently observed.We find that, while the kinematic and structural properties of the merger remnant depends strongly upon the orbital parameters of the mergers, there is a remarkable uniformity in the chemical properties of the mergers. This suggests that general conclusions about the chemical signature of gas-rich mergers can be drawn.},

abstract = {We compare theory and observations for fundamental RR Lyrae in the solar neighborhood and in both Oosterhoff type I (OoI) and type II (OoII) Galactic globular clusters (GGCs). The distribution of cluster RR_ab in the PA_V plane depends not only on the metal abundance, but also on the cluster Horizontal Branch (HB) morphology. On average the observed k_puls parameter, connecting the period to the visual amplitude, increases when moving from metal-poor to metal-rich GGCs. However, this parameter shows marginal changes among OoI clusters with intermediate to red HB types and iron abundances -1.8<= [Fe/H] <=-1.1, whereas its value decreases in OoII clusters with the bluer HB morphology. Moreover, at [Fe/H]=-1.7+-0.1 the OoI clusters present redder HB types and larger <k_puls> values than the OoII clusters. The RR_ab variables in Omega Cen and in the solar neighborhood further support the evidence that the spread in [Fe/H], at fixed k_puls, is of the order of +-0.5 dex. Synthetic HB simulations show that the PA_V plane can provide accurate cluster distance estimates. The RR_ab variables in OoI and in OoII clusters with very blue HB types obey a well-defined M_V(RR)-k_puls relation, while those in OoII clusters with moderately blue HB types present a zero-point that is ~0.05 mag brighter. Regarding field variables, we show that with [Fe/H]=> -1.0 a unique M_V(RR)-k_puls relation can be adopted, independently of the parent HB morphology. Current findings suggest that the PA_V distribution does not seem to be a robust diagnostic for the metal abundance of RR_ab variables. However, the same observables can be used to estimate the absolute magnitude of globular cluster and field RR_ab variables. We show that over the metallicity range -2.4<= [Fe/H] <= 0.0 the M_V(RR)-[Fe/H] relation shows a parabolic behavior.},

abstract = { New broadband UBVRI photoelectric observations on the Johnson-Kron-Cousins photometric system have been made of 202 stars around the sky, and centered at the celestial equator. These stars constitute both an update of and additions to a previously published list of equatorial photometric standard stars. The list is capable of providing, for both celestial hemispheres, an internally consistent homogeneous broadband standard photometric system around the sky. When these new measurements are included with those previously published by Landolt (1992), the entire list of standard stars in this paper encompasses the magnitude range 8.90 < V < 16.30, and the color index range -0.35 < (B - V) < +2.30. },

abstract = {We create a new catalogue of groups and clusters for the 2dF GRS final release sample. We show that the variable linking length friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithms used so far yield groups with sizes that grow systematically with distance from the observer, but FoF algorithms with a constant linking length are free from this fault. We apply the FoF algorithm with a constant linking length for the 2dF GRS, compare for each group its potential and kinetic energies and remove galaxies with excess random velocities. Our sample contains 7657 groups in the Northern part, and 10058 groups in the Southern part of the 2dF survey with membership Ng >= 2. We analyze selection effects of the catalogue and compare our catalogue of groups with other recently published catalogues based on the 2dF GRS. We also estimate the total luminosities of our groups, correcting for group members fainter than the observational limit of the survey. The cluster catalogues are available at our web-site (http://www.aai.ee/~maret/2dfgr.html)},

abstract = {We use the results from recent computations of updated non-linear convective pulsating models to constrain the distance modulus of Galactic globular clusters through the observed periods of first-overtone (RRc) pulsators. The resulting relation between the mean absolute magnitude of RR Lyrae stars <MV(RR)> and the heavy element content [Fe/H] appears well in the range of several previous empirical calibrations, but with a non-linear dependence on [Fe/H] so that the slope of the relation increases when moving towards larger metallicities. On this ground, our results suggest that metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1.5) and metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-1.5) variables follow two different linear <MV(RR)>-[Fe/H] relations. Application to RR Lyrae stars in the metal-poor globular clusters of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) provides an LMC distance modulus of the order of 18.6mag, thus supporting the `long' distance scale. The comparison with recent predictions based on updated stellar evolution theory is briefly presented and discussed.},

title = {Spectroscopy of Bright Quest RR Lyrae Stars: Velocity Substructures Toward Virgo},
abstract = {Using a sample of 43 bright (V < 16.1, distance <13 kpc) RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) from the QUasar Equatorial Survey with spectroscopic radial velocities and metallicities, we find that several separate halo substructures contribute to the Virgo overdensity (VOD). While there is little evidence of a halo substructure in the spatial distribution of these stars, their distribution in radial velocity reveals two moving groups. These results are reinforced when the sample is combined with a sample of blue horizontal branch stars that were identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the combined sample provides evidence for one additional moving group. These groups correspond to peaks in the radial velocity distribution of a sample of F-type main-sequence stars that was recently observed in the same direction by the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE), although in one case the RRLS and F star groups may not lie at the same distance. One of the new substructures has a very narrow range in metallicity, which is more consistent with it being the debris from a destroyed globular cluster than from a dwarf galaxy. A small concentration of stars have radial velocities that are similar to the Virgo Stellar Stream that was identified previously in a fainter sample of RRLS. Our results suggest that this feature extends to distances as short as ~12 kpc, compared to its previous detection at ~19 kpc. None of the new groups and only one star in the sample have velocities that are consistent with membership in the leading tidal stream from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which some authors have suggested is the origin of the VOD.},

title = {Revisiting two local constraints of the Galactic chemical evolution},
abstract = {I review the uncertainties in two observational constraints of the Galactic disc chemical evolution: the metallicity distribution (MD) of long-lived dwarfs and the age-metallicity relation (AMR). It is shown first that the observed MD, designed with standard methods, is more fit to a closed-box model than to the infall MD. We argue that this is due to the specific contribution of the thick disc population, which has been overlooked both in the derivation of the observed MD and in the standard chemical evolution models. Although this agreement disqualifies the MD as the best supportive evidence for infall, we argue that the evolution must be more complex than described by either the closed-box or the standard infall models. A new age-metallicity distribution is obtained, where particularities of the previous recent determinations are phased out. The new AMR shows a mean increase limited to about a factor of 2 in Z over the disc age. It is shown that below 3 Gyrs, the dispersion in metallicity is about 0.1 dex, which, (given the observational uncertainties), is compatible with the small cosmic dispersion measured on the interstellar medium and meteoritic pre-solar dust grains. A population that is progressively older and more metal rich arises at a metallicity greater than that of the Hyades, to reach [Fe/H] ~ +0.5 dex at ages > 5 Gyr. We suggest that this is best explained by radial migration. A symmetrical widening towards lower metallicities is seen at about the same age. Finally, the new derived ages are sufficiently consistent that an AMR within the thick disc is confirmed. These new features altogether draw a picture of the chemical evolution where dynamical effects and complexity in the AMR dominate, rather than a generalized high dispersion at all ages. (abridged)},

abstract = {We investigate whether the subhalos of Lambda-CDM galaxy halos have potentials consistent with the observed properties of Milky Way satellites, particularly those with high-quality photometric and kinematic data: Fornax, Leo I, Sculptor, Sextans, and Carina. We compare spherical models with isotropic velocity dispersion tensors to the observed, circularly averaged star counts, line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles and line-of-sight velocity distributions. We identify subhalos within the six high-resolution dark matter halos of the Aquarius Project for which the spherically averaged potentials result in excellent fits to each of the five galaxies. In particular, our simple one-integral models reproduce the observations in the inner regions, proving that these data are fully consistent with Lambda-CDM expectations and do not require cored dark matter distributions. For four of the five satellites the fits require moderately cusped {\it stellar} density profiles. The star count data for Leo I, however, do require a cored distribution of star counts. Current data suggest that these five satellites may be hosted by Lambda-CDM subhalos with maximum circular velocities in the range 10 to 30 km/s.},

title = {Massive Star Formation: A Tale of Two Theories},
abstract = {The physical mechanism that allows massive stars to form is a major unsolved problem in astrophysics. Stars with masses {\$}\gtsim 20{\$} {\$}\msun{\$} reach the main sequence while still embedded in their natal clouds, and the immense radiation output they generate once fusion begins can exert a force stronger than gravity on the dust and gas around them. They also produce huge Lyman continuum luminosities, which can ionize and potentially unbind their parent clouds. This makes massive star formation a more daunting problem than the formation of low mass stars. In this review I present the current state of the field, and discuss the two primary approaches to massive star formation. One holds that the most massive stars form by direct collisions between lower mass stars and their disks. The other approach is to see if the radiation barrier can be overcome by improved treatment of the radiation-hydrodynamic accretion process. I discuss the theoretical background to each model, the observational predictions that can be used to test them, and the substantial parts of the problem that neither theory has fully addressed.},

title = {Accreted versus In Situ Milky Way Globular Clusters},
abstract = {Here we examine the Milky Way's GC system to estimate the fraction of accreted versus in situ formed GCs. We first assemble a high quality database of ages and metallicities for 93 Milky Way GCs from literature deep colour-magnitude data. The age-metallicity relation for the Milky Way's GCs reveals two distinct tracks - one with near constant old age of ~12.8 Gyr and the other branches to younger ages. We find that the latter young track is dominated by globular clusters associated with the Sagittarius and Canis Major dwarf galaxies. Despite being overly simplistic, its age-metallicity relation can be well represented by a simple closed box model with continuous star formation. The inferred chemical enrichment history is similar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, but is more enriched, at a given age, compared to the Small Magellanic Cloud. After excluding Sagittarius and Canis Major GCs, several young track GCs remain. Their horizontal branch morphologies are often red and hence classified as Young Halo objects, however they do not tend to reveal extended horizontal branches (a possible signature of an accreted remnant nucleus). Retrograde orbit GCs (a key signature of accretion) are commonly found in the young track. We also examine GCs that lie close to the Fornax-Leo-Sculptor great circle defined by several satellite galaxies. We find that several GCs are consistent with the young track and we speculate that they may have been accreted along with their host dwarf galaxy, whose nucleus may survive as a GC. Finally, we suggest that 27-47 GCs (about 1/4 of the entire system), from 6-8 dwarf galaxies, were accreted to build the Milky Way GC system we seen today.},

We compute, for the first time, the abundance gradients for all the above mentioned elements in the galactocentric distance range 4 - 22 kpc. The comparison with the observed data on Cepheids in the galactocentric distance range 5-17 kpc gives a very good agreement for many of the studied elements. In addition, we fit very well the data for the evolution of Lanthanum in the solar vicinity for which we present results here for the first time. We explore, also for the first time, the behaviour of the abundance gradients at large galactocentric distances by comparing our results with data relative to distant open clusters and red giants and select the best chemical evolution model model on the basis of that. We find a very good fit to the observed abundance gradients, as traced by Cepheids, for most of the elements, thus confirming the validity of the inside-out scenario for the formation of the Milky Way disk as well as the adopted nucleosynthesis prescriptions.},

The predicted PL and PLC relations turn out to depend on the pulsator metallicity and, to a minor extent, on the adopted averages (magnitude-weighted or intensity-weighted) over the light cycle in different bands. We show that the determination of the reddening and true distance modulus of a galaxy from the observed PL and PLC relations is constrained by the metallicity sensitivity of these relations. Moreover, the metallicity sensitivity itself provides us with a powerful tool for deriving self-consistent evaluations of distance, reddening and metallicity of the host galaxy, once Cepheid measurements in at least three photometric bands are available. To illustrate this point, we apply our relations to the BVK data for Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, assuming to be unaware of their metallicities. The three filter method is finally adopted to evaluate the metallicity of galactic Cepheids (BVI data) as a function of their position.},

title = {Effects of the galactic winds on the stellar metallicity distribution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies},
abstract = {To study the effects of galactic winds on the stellar metallicity distributions and on the evolution of Draco and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies, we compared the predictions of several chemical evolution models, adopting different prescriptions for the galactic winds, with the photometrically-derived stellar metallicity distributions of both galaxies. The chemical evolution models for Draco and Ursa Minor, which are able to reproduce several observational features of these two galaxies, such as the several abundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account for intermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect of these objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the model that best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurring at a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a wind rate assumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce the observed SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with no galactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor, the same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution very well with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model for Draco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires a model with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency ({\$}\eta_{SNeIa}{\$} = 0.5 instead of {\$}\eta_{SNeIa}{\$} = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind, whereas all the other parameters are kept the same. The model results, compared to observations, strongly suggest that intense and continuous galactic winds play a very important role in the evolution of local dSphs.},

title = {Infall of gas as the formation mechanism of stars up to 20 times more massive than the Sun},
abstract = {Theory predicts and observations confirm that low-mass stars (like the Sun) in their early life grow by accreting gas from the surrounding material. But for stars ~ 10 times more massive than the Sun (~10 M_sun), the powerful stellar radiation is expected to inhibit accretion and thus limit the growth of their mass. Clearly, stars with masses >10 M_sun exist, so there must be a way for them to form. The problem may be solved by non-spherical accretion, which allows some of the stellar photons to escape along the symmetry axis where the density is lower. The recent detection of rotating disks and toroids around very young massive stars has lent support to the idea that high-mass (> 8 M_sun) stars could form in this way. Here we report observations of an ammonia line towards a high-mass star forming region. We conclude from the data that the gas is falling inwards towards a very young star of ~20 M_sun, in line with theoretical predictions of non-spherical accretion.},

title = {On the tidal disruption of dwarf spheroidal galaxies around the galaxy},
abstract = {The Milky Way induces a strong tidal perturbation on its satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We present numerical simulations of tidal interactions between these low-density dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the Milky Way. Our results indicate that dwarf spheroidal galaxies with limiting radius much larger than the theoretical tidal radius are unstable and likely to be tidally disrupted on a Hubble-time. However, dwarf spheroidal galaxies can survive over a Hubble time if their limiting radii are less than twice their tidal radii at perigalacticon. In a galaxy which is undergoing tidal disruption, (1) the projected surface density is flattened in the galaxy's orbital plane and follows a power-law distribution from the galaxy's center, (2) the velocity dispersion is sustained at the current virial equilibrium value, and (3) the central density ofthe residual remnant is maintained even after most of the initial mass is lost. Beyond the tidal radius, the escapers have a radial velocity gradient along the azimuthal direction of the galaxy's motion. When compared with observational data, our theoretical results are consistent with the scenarios that (1) some dwarf spheroidal galaxies contain dark matter, and (2) some dwarf spheroidal galaxies may be part of the debris that was tidally torn from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by the Galaxy.},

The subsequent evolutionary tracks, starting beyond the blue side of the instability strip, move into the strip above the zero-age horizontal branch, producing longer periods in this metallicity range.

title = {The Orbit of the Orphan Stream},
abstract = {We use recent SEGUE spectroscopy and SDSS and SEGUE imaging data to measure the sky position, distance, and radial velocities of stars in the tidal debris stream that is commonly referred to as the "Orphan Stream." We fit orbital parameters to the data, and find a prograde orbit with an apogalacticon, perigalacticon, and eccentricity of 90 kpc, 16.4 kpc and 0.7, respectively. Neither the dwarf galaxy UMa II nor the Complex A gas cloud have velocities consistent with a kinematic association with the Orphan Stream. It is possible that Segue-1 is associated with the Orphan Stream, but no other known Galactic clusters or dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way lie along its orbit. The detected portion of the stream ranges from 19 to 47 kpc from the Sun and is an indicator of the mass interior to these distances. There is a marked increase in the density of Orphan Stream stars near (l,b)=(253,49) deg., which could indicate the presence of the progenitor at the edge of the SDSS data. If this is the progenitor, then the detected portion of the Orphan Stream is a leading tidal tail. We find blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars and F turnoff stars associated with the Orphan Stream. The turnoff color is (g-r)_0=0.22. The BHB stars have a low metallicity of [Fe/H]=-2.1. The orbit is best fit to a halo potential with a halo plus disk mass of about 2.6x10^11 Solar masses, integrated to 60 kpc from the Galactic center. Our best fit is found with a logarithmic halo speed of v_halo=73+/-24 km/s, a disk+bulge mass of M(R< 60 kpc) = 1.3x10^11 Solar masses, and a halo mass of M(R< 60 kpc) = 1.4x10^11 Solar masses. The Orphan Stream is projected to extend to 90 kpc from the Galactic center, and measurements of these distant parts of the stream would be a powerful probe of the mass of the Milky Way (truncated).},

The data allow the preliminary determination of the scale parameters, which lead to strong constraints on the radial and vertical structure of the galactic thin and thick disc. The interpretation of star counts and colour distributions of stars in the near-infrared with the synthetic stellar population model gives strong evidence that the galactic thin disc density scalelength (hR) is rather short (2.8+/-0.3kpc). The galactic thick disc population is revisited in the light of new data. We find the thick disc to have a local density of 3.5+/-2.0per cent of the thin disc, exponential scaleheight (hz) of 860+/-200pc and exponential scalelength (hR) of 3.7+/- 0.5 0.8kpc.},

abstract = {We have derived disk scale lengths for 30374 non-interacting disk galaxies in all five SDSS bands. Virtual Observatory methods and tools were used to define, retrieve, and analyse the images for this unprecedentedly large sample classified as disk/spiral galaxies in the LEDA catalogue. Cross correlation of the SDSS sample with the LEDA catalogue allowed us to investigate the variation of the scale lengths for different types of disk/spiral galaxies. We further investigat asymmetry, concentration, and central velocity dispersion as indicators of morphological type, and are able to assess how the scale length varies with respect to galaxy type. We note however, that the concentration and asymmetry parameters have to be used with caution when investigating type dependence of structural parameters in galaxies. Here, we present the scale length derivation method and numerous tests that we have carried out to investigate the reliability of our results. The average r-band disk scale length is 3.79 kpc, with an RMS dispersion of 2.05 kpc, and this is a typical value irrespective of passband and galaxy morphology, concentration, and asymmetry. The derived scale lengths presented here are representative for a typical galaxy mass of {\$}10^{10.8\pm 0.54} \rm{M}_{\o}dot{\$}, and the RMS dispersion is larger for more massive galaxies. Distributions and typical trends of scale lengths have also been derived in all the other SDSS bands with linear relations that indicate the relation that connect scale lengths in one passband to another. Such transformations could be used to test the results of forthcoming cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution of the Hubble sequence.},

title = {A Two Micron All Sky Survey View of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy. I. Morphology of the Sagittarius Core and Tidal Arms},
abstract = {We present the first all-sky view of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy mapped by M-giant star tracers detected in the complete Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Near-infrared photometry of Sgr's prominent M-giant population permits an unprecedentedly clear view of the center of Sgr. The main body is fitted with a King profile of limiting major-axis radius 30$\,^{\circ}$-substantially larger than previously found or assumed-beyond which is a prominent break in the density profile from stars in the Sgr tidal tails; thus the Sgr radial profile resembles that of Galactic dwarf speroidal (dSph) satellites. Adopting traditional methods for analyzing dSph light profiles, we determine the brightness of the main body of Sgr to be MV=-13.27 (the brightest of the known Galactic dSph galaxies) and the total Sgr mass-to-light ratio to be 25 in solar units. However, we regard the latter result with suspicion and argue that much of the observed structure beyond the King-fit core radius (224') may be outside the actual Sgr tidal radius as the former dwarf spiral/irregular satellite undergoes catastrophic disruption during its last orbits. The M-giant distribution of Sgr exhibits a central density cusp at the same location as, but not due to, the old stars constituting the globular cluster M54. A striking trailing tidal tail is found to extend from the Sgr center and arc across the south Galactic hemisphere with approximately constant density and mean distance varying from ~20 to 40 kpc. A prominent leading debris arm extends from the Sgr center northward of the Galactic plane to an apogalacticon ~45 kpc from the Sun and then turns toward the north Galactic cap (NGC), from where it descends back toward the Galactic plane, becomes foreshortened, and, at brighter magnitudes, covers the NGC. The leading and trailing Sgr tails lie along a well-defined orbital plane about the Galactic center. The Sun lies within a kiloparsec of that plane and near the path of leading Sgr debris; thus, it is possible that former Sgr stars are near or in the solar neighborhood. We discuss the implications of this new view of the Sgr galaxy and its entrails for the character of the Sgr orbit, mass, mass-loss rate, and contribution of stars to the Milky Way halo. The minimal precession displayed by the Sgr tidal debris along its inclined orbit supports the notion of a nearly spherical Galactic potential. The number of M giants in the Sgr tails is at least 15% that contained within the King limiting radius of the main Sgr body. The fact that M giants, presumably formed within the past few gigayears in the Sgr nucleus, are nevertheless so widespread along the Sgr tidal arms not only places limits on the dynamical age of these arms but also poses a timing problem that bears on the recent binding energy of the Sgr core and that is most naturally explained by recent and catastrophic mass loss. Sgr appears to contribute more than 75% of the high-latitude, halo M giants, despite substantial reservoirs of M giants in the Magellanic Clouds. No evidence of extended M-giant tidal debris from the Magellanic Clouds is found. Generally good correspondence is found between the M-giant, all-sky map of the Sgr system and all previously published detections of potential Sgr debris, with the exception of Sgr carbon stars, which must be subluminous compared with counterparts in other Galactic satellites in order to resolve the discrepancy.},

abstract = {The European Gaia astrometry mission is due for launch in 2011. Gaia will rely on the proven principles of the ESA Hipparcos mission to create an all-sky survey of about one billion stars throughout our Galaxy and beyond, by observing all objects down to 20 mag. Through its massive measurement of stellar distances, motions and multicolour photometry, it will provide fundamental data necessary for unravelling the structure, formation and evolution of the Galaxy. This paper presents the design and performance of the broad- and medium-band set of photometric filters adopted as the baseline for Gaia. The 19 selected passbands (extending from the UV to the far-red), the criteria and the methodology on which this choice has been based are discussed in detail. We analyse the photometric capabilities for characterizing the luminosity, temperature, gravity and chemical composition of stars. We also discuss the automatic determination of these physical parameters for the large number of observations involved, for objects located throughout the entire Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Finally, the capability of the photometric system (PS) to deal with the main Gaia science case is outlined.},

A purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the model that predicts the period-metallicity relations in the mediating parameters of colors, amplitudes, and light-curve shapes also explains the Simon-Kovacs et al. correlation between period, φ31, and metallicity. The proof is made by demonstrating that the combination of the first- and third-phase terms in a Fourier decomposition of RRab light curves, called φ31 by Simon {\&} Lee, varies monotonically across the RR Lyrae instability strip in the same way that amplitude, color, and rise time vary with period within the strip. The premise of the model is that if horizontal branches at the RR Lyrae strip are stacked in luminosity according to the metallicity, then there necessarily must be a logperiod shift between RR Lyrae stars with different metallicities at the same φ31 values. However, there are exceptions to the model. The two metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441, with anomalously long periods of their RR Lyrae stars for their amplitudes, violate the period-metallicity correlations both in amplitudes and in φ31 values (for NGC 6441 where φ31 data exist). The cause must be related to the anomalously bright horizontal branches in these two clusters for their metallicities. The effect of luminosity evolution away from the zero-age horizontal branch, putatively causing noise in the metallicity equation, is discussed. It is clearly seen in the amplitude-period correlations but apparently does not exist in the φ31-period correlation in the data for the globular cluster M3 analyzed by Jurcsik and coworkers and by Cacciari and Fusi Pecci, for reasons not presently understood. Clarification can be expected from study of precision photometric data of evolved RR Lyrae stars in globular clusters of different metallicity when their Fourier components are known.},

title = {The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Population II Cepheids in the Galactic Bulge},
abstract = {We present I-band light curves of 54 Population II Cepheids identified in the OGLE-II catalog of variable objects in the Galactic bulge fields. Their periods range from a fraction of a day to several days. Their light curves show very close similarity to the light curves of classical Cepheids with periods a few times longer. We analyze location of the newly identified Population II Cepheids in the color--magnitude diagram. The position of these objects confirms recent discovery that the interstellar extinction toward the Galactic bulge might be anomalous. The slope of the reddening line obtained from our sample is in very good agreement with the earlier one derived with red clump stars and the one derived with RR~Lyr stars in the Galactic bulge. Our Population II Cepheids follow the same period--luminosity (P--L) relation indicating similar status of these objects. We compare the P--L relation of these stars with the relation of Population II Cepheid detected by the OGLE-II survey in the LMC. Deviations from the P--L relation of the Galactic bulge Cepheids seem to indicate that these objects are located in the Galactic bar similarly to red clump stars.},

title = {Models for Massive Stellar Populations with Rotation},
abstract = {We present and discuss evolutionary synthesis models for massive stellar populations generated with the Starburst99 code in combination with a new set of stellar evolution models accounting for rotation. The new stellar evolution models were compiled from several data releases of the Geneva group and cover heavy-element abundances ranging from twice solar to one fifth solar. The evolution models were computed for rotation velocities on the zero-age main-sequence of 0 and 300 km/s and with the latest revision of stellar mass-loss rates. Since the mass coverage is incomplete, in particular at non-solar chemical composition, our parameter study is still preliminary and must be viewed as exploratory. Stellar population properties computed with Starburst99 and the new evolution models show some marked differences in comparison with models obtained using earlier tracks. Since individual stars now tend to be more luminous and bluer when on the blue side of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the populations mirror this trend. For instance, increases by factors of two or more are found for the light-to-mass ratios at ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths, as well as for the output of hydrogen ionizing photons. If these results are confirmed once the evolution models have matured, recalibrations of certain star-formation and initial mass function indicators will be required.},

AQ Leo was the first known double-mode RR Lyrae pulsator (RRd star). Three decades after its discovery, MOST observations have revealed that AQ Leo oscillates with at least 42 frequencies, of which 32 are linear combinations (up to the sixth order) of the radial fundamental mode and its first overtone. Evidence for period changes of these modes is found in the data. The other intrinsic frequencies may represent an additional nonradial pulsation mode and its harmonics (plus linear combinations) which warrant theoretical modeling. The unprecedented number of frequencies detected with amplitudes down to millimag precision also presents an opportunity to test nonlinear theories of mode growth and saturation in RR Lyrae pulsators.},

Full space motions for a sub-sample of 16920 stars, exploring a local volume within 4 kpc of the Sun, are used to derive velocity ellipsoids for the inner- and outer-halo components of the Galaxy, as well as for the canonical thick-disk and proposed metal-weak thick-disk populations. We first examine the question of whether the data require the presence of at least a two-component halo in order to account for the rotational behavior of likely halo stars in the local volume, and whether more than two components are needed. We also address the question of whether the metal-weak thick disk is kinematically and chemically distinct from the canonical thick disk. In addition, we consider the fractions of each component required to understand the nature of the observed kinematic behavior of the stellar populations of the Galaxy as a function of distance from the plane. Scale lengths and scale heights for the thick-disk and metal-weak thick-disk components are determined. Spatial density profiles for the inner- and outer-halo populations are inferred from a Jeans Theorem analysis. The full set of calibration stars (including those outside the local volume) is used to test for the expected changes in the observed stellar metallicity distribution function with distance above the Galactic plane in-situ, due to the changing contributions from the underlying stellar populations.

Considerable theoretical effort has been put into explaining their formation and evolution, both analytically and with numerical simulations. In some theories, structures form during the natural evolution of the galaxy, i.e. they are a result of nature. For others, it is the interaction with other galaxies, or with the intergalactic medium - i.e. nurture - that accounts for a structure. Either way, the existence and properties of these structures reveal important information on the underlying potential of the galaxy, i.e. on the amount and distribution of matter - including the dark matter - in it, and on the evolutionary history of the galaxy. Here, I will briefly review the various formation scenarios and the respective role of nature and nurture in the formation, evolution and properties of the main structures and substructures.},

The 300 pc scale height component is identified as an old disk, and the 1350 pc scale height component as a Galactic 'thick disk'.

Star formation (SF) is modeled by assuming that a local heating center is turned on every time the local density exceeds a threshold value. The heating then remains on for a time typical of the lifetimes of OB stars. Supernovae, magnetic fields, and rotation effects (Coriolis and centrifugal forces) are not considered. We discuss both the structure and the evolution of the model using parameters appropiate to the interstellar medium (ISM) at the scale of 1 kpc in the plane of the Galactic disk, although many of the results should be applicable to other scales with marginally important sef-gravity. Also discussed are dynamical aspects of the turbulence in these flows.},

We show that the asymmetric warps are more pronounced when the dark matter content within the optical disk is lower as in early-type galaxies.},

M33 does not possess a traditional bulge; instead, it has a small nuclear region hosting stars with a wide range of ages. The star formation history of the M33 halo is poorly constrained, but composite spectra of its halo globular clusters imply a wide age spread of 5 - 7 years, while the presence of RR Lyrae stars in the halo implies at least some of the population is ancient. Although it is possible to obtain the detailed star formation history of the M33 halo via deep photometry, this has not been done to date. M31 hosts a traditional bulge that is apparently dominated by stars older than 10 Gyr. Deep photometry of the M31 halo demonstrates that it hosts both a population of ancient metal-poor stars and a significant population extending to younger ages and high metallicity, apparently due to its active merger history. },

As stressed by several authors, observations towards multiple directions are needed in order to resolve the correlations between the various model parameters. Here, we present a new survey over about 140 square degrees based on the material used for the construction of the Second Guide Star Catalog (GSC-II). A sample of about 20 000 K dwarfs up to 3 kpc selected from multiple fields towards high and intermediate latitudes has been analysed in order to trace the spatial distribution of the thick disc. Photometric parallaxes (30% accuracy) have been computed taking into account the systematics effects due to the Malmquist bias, the Eddington bias, the metallicity gradients, and the contamination of giants and binaries. A least-squares analysis of the seven fields supports a thick disc with a vertical scaleheight, hz 1.0 kpc and a relative density of about 5% and a radial scale-length hR 3.2 kpc, and a thin disc with hz 240 pc. Finally, the impact of the accurate astrometric measurements, including absolute parallaxes, expected from Gaia is discussed.},

title = {A New Milky Way Companion: Unusual Globular Cluster or Extreme Dwarf Satellite?},
abstract = {We report the discovery of SDSS J1049+5103, an overdensity of resolved blue stars at (α2000,δ2000)=(162.343d,51.051d). This object appears to be an old, metal-poor stellar system at a distance of 45+/-10 kpc, with a half-light radius of 23+/-10 pc and an absolute magnitude of MV=-3.0+2.0-0.7. One star that is likely associated with this Milky Way companion has an SDSS spectrum confirming it as a blue horizontal-branch star at 48 kpc. The color-magnitude diagram of SDSS J1049+5103 contains few, if any, horizontal or red giant branch stars, similar to the anomalously faint globular cluster AM 4. The size and luminosity of SDSS J1049+5103 places it at the intersection of the size-luminosity relationships followed by known globular clusters and by Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. If SDSS J1049+5103 is a globular cluster, then its properties are consistent with the established trend that the largest radius Galactic globular clusters are all in the outer halo. However, the five known globular clusters with similarly faint absolute magnitudes all have half-mass radii that are smaller than SDSS J1049+5103 by a factor of >~5. If it is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, then it is the faintest yet known by 2 orders of magnitude and is the first example of the ultrafaint dwarfs predicted by some theories. The uncertain nature of this new system underscores the sometimes ambiguous distinction between globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. A simple friends-of-friends search for similar, blue, small scale length star clusters detected all known globular clusters and dwarfs closer than 50 kpc in the SDSS area but yielded no other candidates as robust as SDSS J1049+5103.},

abstract = {I present V-band CCD photometry for a sample of 103 RR Lyrae variables selected from the General Catalogue of Variable Stars to lie in the inner halo of the Galaxy. I also describe a method for obtaining the mean apparent magnitude and the epoch at maximum light of an RR Lyrae star. The method requires as few as five photometric observations, and simulations demonstrate that the associated errors are relatively small. I employ this method to derive the mean magnitudes and maximum light epochs of the 103 RR Lyrae stars observed. These stars were selected, based on their Galactic coordinates and original photographic photometry, to lie near their orbital tangent points, thus providing a sample well suited for measuring the rotational kinematics of the inner halo. Using interstellar reddenings from the literature and the observed mean V magnitudes, I derive distances for these stars and show that their actual locations in the Galaxy are indeed suitable for use in a kinematic study, despite the large zero-point errors in the survey photographic photometry.},

title = {alpha-, r-, and s-process element trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks},
abstract = {From a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 102 F and G dwarf stars we present abundance trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks for 14 elements (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, Ba, and Eu). Stellar parameters and elemental abundances (except for Y, Ba and Eu) for 66 of the 102 stars were presented in our previous studies (Bensby et al. 2003, 2004a). The 36 stars that are new in this study extend and confirm our previous results and allow us to draw further conclusions regarding abundance trends. The s-process elements Y and Ba, and the r-element Eu have also been considered here for the whole sample for the first time. With this new larger sample we now have the following results: 1) Smooth and distinct trends that for the thin and thick disks are clearly separated; 2) The alpha-element trends for the thick disk show typical signatures from the enrichment of SNIa; 3) The thick disk stellar sample is in the mean older than the thin disk stellar sample; 4) The thick disk abundance trends are invariant with galactocentric radii (R_m); 5) The thick disk abundance trends appear to be invariant with vertical distance (Z_max) from the Galactic plane. Adding further evidence from the literaure we argue that a merger/interacting scenario with a companion galaxy to produce a kinematical heating of the stars (that make up today's thick disk) in a pre-existing old thin disk is the most likely formation scenario for the Galactic thick disk.},

abstract = {Overdensities in the distribution of low latitude, 2MASS giant stars are revealed by systematically peeling away from sky maps the bulk of the giant stars conforming to ``isotropic'' density laws generally accounting for known Milky Way components. This procedure, combined with a higher resolution treatment of the sky density of both giants and dust allows us to probe to lower Galactic latitudes than previous 2MASS giant star studies. While the results show the swath of excess giants previously associated with the Monoceros ring system in the second and third Galactic quadrants at distances of 6-20 kpc, we also find a several times larger overdensity of giants in the same distance range concentrated in the direction of the ancient constellation Argo. Isodensity contours of the large structure suggest that it is highly elongated and inclined by about 3 deg to the disk, although details of the structure -- including the actual location of highest density, overall extent, true shape -- and its origin, remain unknown because only a fraction of it lies outside highly dust-obscured, low latitude regions. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the 2MASS M giant overdensity previously claimed to represent the core of a dwarf galaxy in Canis Major (l ~ 240 deg) is an artifact of a dust extinction window opening to the overall density rise to the more significant Argo structure centered at larger longitude (l ~ 290 +- 10 deg, b ~ -4 +- 2 deg).},

abstract = {Standard cosmology predicts that dwarfs were the first galaxies to be formed in the universe and that many of them merge afterward to form bigger galaxies such as the Milky Way. This process would have left behind traces such as tidal debris or star streams in the outer halo. We report here the detection of a very low density stellar system at 50+/-10 kpc from the Galactic center that could be related to the merger process. It could form part of the Sagittarius northern stream or, alternatively, could be the trace of a hitherto unknown dwarf galaxy. The dwarf galaxy in Sagittarius, the closest satellite of the Milky Way, is currently being tidally disrupted and is a ``living'' test for galaxy formation theories. The system found here is 60$\,^{\circ}$ away from the center of the Sagittarius galaxy. If it is really associated with this galaxy, it would confirm predictions of dynamical interaction models indicating that tidal debris from Sagittarius could extend along a stream completely enveloping the Milky Way in a polar orbit.},

abstract = {Models for chemical evolution of the Galaxy are presented, where the most recent ideas on stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova (SN) progenitors are taken into account. It is assumed that the disk forms by accretion of primordial material coming from outside with a time-scale which is a function of the galactocentric distance. The possibility of forming the disk out of enriched halo gas is also studied in a simple way. The evolution of the abundances of several single elements is predicted as well as that of gas mass, SN rates and star formation rate, both in the solar neighborhood and in the whole disk, under different assumptions for the star formation rate. Abundance gradients along the galactic disk are well reproduced and a possible interpretation for the differences among gradients of different elements is given in terms of nucleosynthesis and stellar lifetimes. This interpretation can represent a key for understanding gradients also in external galaxies. In particular, a natural explanation is suggested for the positive gradient of S/O, found in M101 and M33.},

It is found that a large part of the nuclear flow in the r-process may be carried by charged particle reactions up to about A of about 100. It is speculated that the site of these processes is the high-entropy 'wind' of a young neutron star in which neutrino energy deposition is driving mass loss. The pass of r-process ejected per supernova is expected to be about 0.0001 solar mass per Type II or Ib supernova, but this is sensitive to details of the presupernova structure, the explosion mechanism, and the amount of material that falls back onto the neutron star when the reverse shock arrives there.},

title = {How do Galaxies Accrete Gas and Form Stars?},
abstract = { Great strides have been made in the last two decades in determining how galaxies evolve from their initial dark matter seeds to the complex structures we observe at z=0. The role of mergers has been documented through both observations and simulations, numerous satellites that may represent these initial dark matter seeds have been discovered in the Local Group, high redshift galaxies have been revealed with monstrous star formation rates, and the gaseous cosmic web has been mapped through absorption line experiments. Despite these efforts, the dark matter simulations that include baryons are still unable to accurately reproduce galaxies. One of the major problems is our incomplete understanding of how a galaxy accretes its baryons and subsequently forms stars. Galaxy formation simulations have been unable to accurately represent the required gas physics on cosmological timescales, and observations have only just begun to detect the star formation fuel over a range of redshifts and environments. How galaxies obtain gas and subsequently form stars is a major unsolved, yet tractable problem in contemporary extragalactic astrophysics. In this paper we outline how progress can be made in this area in the next decade. },

title = {The Predicted Metallicity Distribution of Stars in Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies},
abstract = {We predict the metallicity distribution of stars and the age-metallicity relation for 6 Dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of the Local Group by means of a chemical evolution model which is able to reproduce several observed abundance ratios and the present day total mass and gas content of these galaxies. The model adopts up to date nucleosynthesis and takes into account the role played by supernovae of different types (II, Ia) allowing us to follow in detail the evolution of several chemical elements (H, D, He, C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe). Each galaxy model is specified by the prescriptions of the star formation rate and by the galactic wind efficiency chosen to reproduce the main features of these galaxies. These quantities are constrained by the star formation histories of the galaxies as inferred by the observed color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). The main conclusions are: i) 5 of the 6 dSphs galaxies are characterized by very low star formation efficiencies ({\$}\nu = 0.005 - 0.5 Gyr ^{-1}{\$}) with only Sagittarius having a higher one ({\$}\nu = 1.0 - 5.0 Gyr ^{-1}{\$}); ii) the wind efficiency is high for all galaxies, in the range {\$}w_i{\$} = 6 - 15; iii) a high wind efficiency is required in order to reproduce the abundance ratios and the present day gas mass of the galaxies; iv) the predicted age-metallicity relation implies that the stars of the dSphs reach solar metallicities in a time-scale of the order of 2 - 6 Gyr; v) the metallicity distributions of stars in dSphs exhibit a peak around [Fe/H] {\$}\sim{\$} -1.8 to -1.5 dex, with the exception of Sagittarius ([Fe/H] {\$}\sim{\$} -0.8 dex); iv) the predicted metallicity distributions of stars suggest that the majority of stars in dSphs are formed in a range of metallicity in agreement with the one of the observed stars.},

title = {A Comprehensive Model for the Monoceros Tidal Stream},
abstract = {We have compiled an extensive data set on potential parts of the Monoceros tidal stream and performed an exhaustive survey of dwarf galaxy semianalytic orbits in order to constrain its orbital properties. The best-fit orbits are subsequently realized as self-consistent N-body simulations in order to reproduce the spatial and velocity distribution of satellite debris. We find that all kinematic and geometric constraints can be fit by a single stream allowing for multiple wraps. The orbital eccentricity and inclination of the progenitor are strongly constrained to be e=0.10+/-0.05 and i=25deg+/-5deg. Ten new estimates of proper motions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey clearly exclude all retrograde orbits. Particles lost by the satellite populate two nearly concentric rings, naturally explaining the detection of stream stars at both 6-8 kpc (Ibata et al.; Newberg et al.) and 12-18 kpc (the Tri/And stream; Rocha-Pinto et al.) from the Sun. We have attempted to predict the present location of the Monoceros stream progenitor using different information: (1) the kinematical and spatial distribution of detections, and (2) the different mean metallicity in the inner and the outer rings. Because of the lack of observational data in the whole range of Galactic latitudes, the geometrical/kinematical constraints lead to a wide range of possible locations. By associating older parts of the model stream with lower metallicity parts of the observed data, we argue in favor of a current location of l~245deg, b~-18deg, with a distance to the Sun rs~=15 kpc. The mass of the progenitor has been poorly constrained because of the slow orbital decay. Similar fits have been obtained for masses (3-9)×108Msolar. We have analyzed the possible common origin of the Canis Major dwarf and the Monoceros stream. The Canis Major dwarf moves on a prograde, nearly circular orbit (e~=0.16) in the Milky Way disk (i~=4+14-4 deg). This orbital inclination is too low to account for the large vertical dispersion of stream stars. However, the bimodal distribution of radial velocities in the central region found by Martin et al. probably indicates that their selection criteria for identifying dwarf stars lead to a contamination of background stars. In that case, the kinematical data outlined above might result in an underestimate of the orbital inclination. Finally, the distance estimation to Canis Major dwarf is around a factor of 2 smaller than that obtained from our model. Unfortunately, the possible identification of the Monoceros stream progenitor in Canis Major remains unclear.},

title = {VLT/UVES Abundances in Four Nearby Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies. II. Implications for Understanding Galaxy Evolution},
abstract = {We have used the Ultraviolet Visual-Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) on Kueyen (UT2) of the Very Large Telescope to take spectra of 15 individual red giant stars in the centers of four nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph's): Sculptor, Fornax, Carina, and Leo I. We measure the abundance variations of numerous elements in these low-mass stars with a range of ages (1-15 Gyr old). This means that we can effectively measure the chemical evolution of these galaxies with time. Our results show a significant spread in metallicity with age, but an overall trend consistent with what might be expected from a closed- (or perhaps leaky-) box chemical evolution scenario over the last 10-15 Gyr. We make comparisons between the properties of stars observed in dSph's and in our Galaxy's disk and halo, as well as globular cluster populations in our Galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We also look for the signature of the earliest star formation in the universe, which may have occurred in these small systems. We notice that each of these galaxies show broadly similar abundance patterns for all elements measured. This suggests a fairly uniform progression of chemical evolution with time, despite quite a large range of star formation histories. It seems likely that these galaxies had similar initial conditions, and that they evolve in a similar manner with star formation occurring at a uniformly low rate, even if at different times. With our accurate measurements we find evidence for small variations in abundances, which seem to be correlated to variations in star formation histories between different galaxies. The α-element abundances suggest that dSph chemical evolution has not been affected by very high mass stars (>15-20 Msolar). The abundance patterns we measure for stars in dSph's are significantly different from those typically observed in the disk, bulge, and inner halo of our Galaxy. This means that, as far as we can tell from the (limited) data available to date, it is impossible to construct a significant fraction of our disk, inner halo, or bulge from stars formed in dSph's such as we see today, which subsequently merged into our own. Any merger scenario involving dSph's has to occur in the very early universe while they are still gas-rich, so the majority of mass transfer is gas and few stars. Based on Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, proposals 66.B-0320, 65.N-0378, 62.N-0653, and 61.A-0275.},

abstract = {Newberg et al., Yanny et al., Ibata et al., Rocha-Pinto et al., and Martin et al. have reported overdensities of stars that form a ring with a galactocentric distance (Rgal) of <~18 kpc. Martin et al. and Frinchaboy et al. have found star clusters associated with these overdensities; Martin et al. found what seems to be the central overdensity in Canis Major, so we shall refer to it as the CMa ring. The stars in the CMa ring have a small velocity dispersion and [Fe/H] of about -0.4 and -1.6, respectively. Zinn et al. found a small RR Lyrae overdensity in the more populous southern arc of the CMa ring. We do not find any overdensity of RR Lyrae stars in a 65 deg2 field that covers a more tenuous part of the ring in the anticenter. Existing evidence suggests that the halo component of the CMa ring has a horizontal-branch (HB) morphology that does not favor RR Lyrae stars; the evidence from the associated clusters suggests that it may be richer in blue HB stars. Our RR Lyrae sample in the anticenter contains three groups (each containing three stars that have a high probability of physical association). These groups account for half of the RR Lyrae stars with 17 kpc<=Rgal<=28 kpc in this field; all of these RR Lyrae stars are of Oosterhoff I type. It is suggested that they may be globular cluster remnants.},

title = {The remnants of galaxy formation from a panoramic survey of the region around M31},
abstract = {In hierarchical cosmological models, galaxies grow in mass through the continual accretion of smaller ones. The tidal disruption of these systems is expected to result in loosely bound stars surrounding the galaxy, at distances that reach {\$}10 - 100{\$} times the radius of the central disk. The number, luminosity and morphology of the relics of this process provide significant clues to galaxy formation history, but obtaining a comprehensive survey of these components is difficult because of their intrinsic faintness and vast extent. Here we report a panoramic survey of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We detect stars and coherent structures that are almost certainly remnants of dwarf galaxies destroyed by the tidal field of M31. An improved census of their surviving counterparts implies that three-quarters of M31's satellites brighter than {\$}M_V < -6{\$} await discovery. The brightest companion, Triangulum (M33), is surrounded by a stellar structure that provides persuasive evidence for a recent encounter with M31. This panorama of galaxy structure directly confirms the basic tenets of the hierarchical galaxy formation model and reveals the shared history of M31 and M33 in the unceasing build-up of galaxies.},

title = {Supernovae as the Site of the r-Process: Implications for Gamma-Ray Astronomy},
abstract = {We discuss how detection of gamma-ray emission from the decay of r-process nuclei can improve our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis. We find that a gamma-ray detector with a sensitivity of ~10^-7gamma cm^-2 s^-1 at E_gamma ~ 100-700 keV may detect the emission from the decay of ^125Sb, ^137Cs, ^144Ce, ^155Eu, and ^194Os produced in a future Galactic supernova. In addition, such a detector may determine the emission from the decay of ^126Sn in the Vela supernova remnant and the diffuse emission from the decay of ^126Sn produced by past supernovae in our Galaxy. The required detector sensitivity is similar to what is projected for the proposed Advanced Telescope for High Energy Nuclear Astrophysics (ATHENA). Both the detection of gamma-ray emission from the decay of several r-process nuclei (e.g., ^125Sb and ^194Os) produced in future Galactic supernovae and the detection of emission from the decay of ^126Sn in the Vela supernova remnant would prove that supernovae are a site of the r-process. Furthermore, the former detection would allow us to determine whether or not the r-process nuclei are produced in relative proportions specified by the solar r-process abundance pattern in supernova r-process events. Finally, detection of diffuse emission from the decay of ^126Sn in our Galaxy would eliminate neutron star-neutron star mergers as the main source for the r-process nuclei near mass number A ~ 126.},

title = {Stellar Over-densities in the Outer Halo of the Milky Way},
abstract = {This study presents a tomographic survey of a subset of the outer halo (10-40 kpc) drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6. Halo substructure on spatial scales of {\$}>3{\$} degrees is revealed as an excess in the local density of sub-giant stars. With an appropriate assumption of a model stellar isochrone it is possible for us to then derive distances to the sub-giant population. We describe three new candidate halo substructures; the 160- and 180-degree over-densities (at distances of 17 and 19 kpc respectively and radii of 1.3 and 1.5 kpc respectively) and an extended feature at 28 kpc that covers at least 162 square degrees, the Virgo Equatorial Stream. In addition, we recover the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) leading arm material and the Virgo Over-density. The derived distances, together with the number of sub-giant stars associated with each substructure, enables us to derive the integrated luminosity for the features. The tenuous, low surface brightness of the features strongly suggests an origin from the tidal disruption of an accreted galaxy or galaxies. Given the dominance of the tidal debris of Sgr in this region of the sky we investigate if our observations can be accommodated by tidal disruption models for Sgr. The clear discordance between observations and model predictions for known Sgr features means it is difficult to tell unambiguously if the new substructures are related to Sgr or not. Radial velocities in the stellar over-densities will be critical in establishing their origins.},

title = {Testing a pulsating binary model for long secondary periods in red variables},
abstract = {The origin of the long secondary periods (LSPs) in red variables remains a mystery up to now, although there exist many models. The light curves of some LSPs stars mimic an eclipsing binary with a pulsating red giant component. To test this hypothesis, the observational data of two LSP variable red giants, 77.7795.29 and 77.8031.42, discovered by the MACHO project from the LMC, are collected and analyzed. The probable eclipsing features of the light curves are simulated by the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) method. The simulation yields a contact and a semidetached geometry for the two systems, respectively. In addition, the pulsation constant of the main pulsating component in each binary system is derived. By combining the results of the binary model and the pulsation component, we investigate the feasibility of the pulsating binary model. It is found that the radial velocity curve expected from the binary model has a much larger amplitude than the observed one and a period double the observed one. Furthermore, the masses of the components based on the density derived from the binary orbit solution are too low to be compatible with both the evolutionary stage and the high luminosity. Although the pulsation mode identified by the pulsation constant which is dependent on the density from the binary-model is consistent with the first or second overtone radial pulsation, we conclude that the pulsating binary model is a defective model for the LSP.},

abstract = {We present a survey of satellites around a homogeneous set of late-type spirals with luminosity similar to that of the Milky Way. On average, we find fewer than 1.5 satellites per primary, but we argue that we can treat the survey as an ensemble and so derive the properties of the halo of a 'typical' isolated spiral. The projected density profile of the ensemble falls off approximately as 1/r. Within 50 kpc the azimuthal distribution of satellites shows some evidence for the 'Holmberg effect', an excess near the minor axis of the primary; however, at larger projected distances, the distribution appears isotropic. There is a weak but significant correlation between the size of a satellite and its distance from its primary, as expected if satellites are tidally truncated. Neither Hubble type nor spectral characteristics correlate with apparent separation. The ensemble of satellites appears to be rotating at about 30 km/s in the same direction as the galactic disk. Satellites on prograde orbits tend to be brighter than those on retrograde orbits. The typical velocity difference between a satellite and its primary shows no clear dependence either on apparent separation, or on the rotation speed of the primary. Thus our survey demonstrates that isolated spiral galaxies have massive halos that extend to many optical radii.},

title = {Evidence for Distinct Components of the Galactic Stellar Halo from 838 RR Lyrae Stars Discovered in the LONEOS-I Survey},
abstract = {We present 838 ab-type RR Lyrae stars from the Lowell Observatory Near Earth Objects Survey Phase I (LONEOS-I). These objects cover 1430 deg2 and span distances ranging from 3 to 30 kpc from the Galactic center. Object selection is based on phased, photometric data with 28-50 epochs. We use this large sample to explore the bulk properties of the stellar halo, including the spatial distribution. The period-amplitude distribution of this sample shows that the majority of these RR Lyrae stars resemble Oosterhoff type I, but there is a significant fraction (26%) which have longer periods and appear to be Oosterhoff type II. We find that the radial distributions of these two populations have significantly different profiles (ρOoI~R-2.26+/-0.07 and ρOoII~R-2.88+/-0.11). This suggests that the stellar halo was formed by at least two distinct accretion processes and supports dual-halo models.},

abstract = {We have searched for in-falling stellar streams on to the local Milky Way disc in the CORAVEL and RAVE surveys. The CORAVEL survey consists of local dwarf stars (Nordstrom et al. Geneva-Copenhagen survey) and local Famaey et al. giant stars. We select RAVE stars with radial velocities that are sensitive to the Galactic vertical space velocity (Galactic latitude b < -45 deg). Kuiper statistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the Galactic vertical velocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net vertical flow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with vertically coherent kinematics. In contrast to the `Field of Streams' found in the outer halo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by the CORAVEL dwarfs (complete within ~3 x 10^-4 kpc^3), CORAVEL giants (complete within ~5 x 10^-2 kpc^3) and RAVE (5-15% complete within ~8 kpc^3) are devoid of any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars. This is sufficiently sensitive to allow our RAVE sample to rule out the passing of the tidal stream of the disrupting Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy through the solar neighbourhood. This agrees with the most recent determination of its orbit and dissociates it from the Helmi et al. halo stream. Our constraints on the absence of the Sgr stream near the Sun could prove a useful tool for discriminating between Galactic potential models. The lack of a net vertical flow through the solar neighbourhood in the CORAVEL giants and RAVE samples argues against the Virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the Sun. There are no vertical streams in the CORAVEL giants and RAVE samples with stellar densities >1.6 x 10^4 and 1.5 x 10^3 stars kpc^-3 respectively and therefore no evidence for locally enhanced dark matter.},

title = {Evidence for a Triaxial Milky Way Dark Matter Halo from the Sagittarius Stellar Tidal Stream},
abstract = {Observations of the lengthy tidal streams produced by the destruction of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) are capable of providing strong constraints on the shape of the Galactic gravitational potential. However, previous work, based on modeling different stream properties in axisymmetric Galactic models has yielded conflicting results: while the angular precession of the Sgr leading arm is most consistent with a spherical or slightly oblate halo, the radial velocities of stars in this arm are only reproduced by prolate halo models. We demonstrate that this apparent paradox can be resolved by instead adopting a triaxial potential. Our new Galactic halo model, which simultaneously fits all well-established phase space constraints from the Sgr stream, provides the first conclusive evidence for, and tentative measurement of, triaxiality in an individual dark matter halo. The Milky Way halo within ~ 60 kpc is best characterized by a minor/major axis ratio of the isovelocity contours c/a ~ 0.67, intermediate/major axis ratio b/a ~ 0.83, and triaxiality parameter T ~ 0.56. In this model, the minor axis of the dark halo is coincident with the Galactic X axis connecting the Sun and the Galactic Center to within ~ 15 degrees, while the major axis also lies in the Galactic plane, approximately along the Galactic Y axis.},

abstract = {We use a sample of newly-discovered globular clusters from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) in combination with previously-catalogued objects to map the spatial distribution of globular clusters in the M31 halo. At projected radii beyond ~30 kpc, where large coherent stellar streams are readily distinguished in the field, there is a striking correlation between these features and the positions of the globular clusters. Adopting a simple Monte Carlo approach, we test the significance of this association by computing the probability that it could be due to the chance alignment of globular clusters smoothly distributed in the M31 halo. We find the likelihood of this possibility is low, below 1%, and conclude that the observed spatial coincidence between globular clusters and multiple tidal debris streams in the outer halo of M31 reflects a genuine physical association. Our results imply that the majority of the remote globular cluster system of M31 has been assembled as a consequence of the accretion of cluster-bearing satellite galaxies. This constitutes the most direct evidence to date that the outer halo globular cluster populations in some galaxies are largely accreted.},

abstract = {In the context of dwarf spheroidal galaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine Blue Stragglers (BSS) population from a normal young main (MS) sequence. This difficulty is persistent. For a sample of 9 non-star forming Local Group dwarf galaxies we compute the ``BSS frequency'' and compare it with that found in the Milky Way globular/open clusters and halo. The comparison shows that the BSS-frequency in dwarf galaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of similar luminosities. Moreover, the estimated BSS-frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf galaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo and open clusters. We conclude that the low density, almost collision-less environment, of our dwarf galaxy sample point to their very low dynamical evolution and consequent negligible production of collisional BSS.},

In particular, I will highlight some important observational facts explained by means of massive stars in galaxies of different morphological type: the Milky Way, ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. I will describe first the time-delay model and its interpretation in terms of abundance ratios in galaxies, then I will discuss the importance of mass loss in massive stars to reproduce the data in the Galactic bulge and disk. I will discuss also how massive stars can be important producers of primary nitrogen if rotation in stellar models is taken into account. Concerning elliptical galaxies, I will show that to reproduce the observed [Mg/Fe] versus Mass relation in these galaxies it is necessary to assume a more important role of massive stars in more massive galaxies and that this can be achieved by means of downsizing in star formation. I will discuss how massive stars are responsible in triggering galactic winds both in ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. These latter systems show a low overabundance of alpha-elements relative to Fe with respect to Galactic stars of the same [Fe/H]: this is interpreted as due to a slow star formation coupled with very efficient galactic winds. Finally, I will show a comparison between the predicted Type Ib/c rates in galaxies and the observed GRB rate and how we can impose constraints on the mechanism of galaxy formation by studying the GRB rate at high redshift.},

title = {The Signature of Galactic Tides in Local Group Dwarf Spheroidals},
abstract = { (Abridged) We use N-body simulations to explore the effects of tidal stripping on the structure of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). We model dSphs as King spheres embedded in NFW dark halos that orbit the Galactic potential on eccentric orbits. We find that episodes of stellar mass loss remove the initial cutoff of the bound stellar core. Once equilibrium has been re-established the outer mass profile approaches a power-law in projection that is well described by a simple Plummer model. Tides also result in transient features in the outer density profile. As the system re-equilibrates, an outward-moving "excess" of stars is found at radii where the local crossing time exceeds the time elapsed since pericenter. If the orbit is known, these results provide a simple way to assess whether "breaks" and "bumps" in the profile of dSphs are actually tidal in origin. We apply this to the Sagittarius dwarf and, encouragingly, identify two features in the profile that may be traced to its two last pericentric passages. Applied to Leo I, we find that any tidal break would locate beyond the area surveyed by current data, casting doubt on recent claims of the detection of tidal debris around this galaxy. For Carina, the tidal break should occur at a radius twice farther than observed, suggesting that the outer excess of stars is not tidal in origin unless its orbit is in error. A similar comment applies to Sculptor, whose pericenter appears too large for Galactic tides to be important but whose outer profile, like that of Draco, nonetheless follows closely a Plummer-law. Fornax and Leo II show no sign of a power-law outer profile, suggesting that they have not suffered stellar tidal stripping. Published profiles for other, fainter Milky Way dSph companions do not extend sufficiently far to allow for conclusive assessment. },

title = {The Structure of Cold Dark Matter Halos},
abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

abstract = {Color magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of individual stars in 8 globular clusters (GCs) in M3 1 down to about 1 mag fainter (V˜26.5) than the horizontal branch (HB) have been obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope-HST. In particular, we observed G280 and G35 1 with the FOC (f/96 + F430W and f/96+F480LP) while the WFPC2 (F555W, F814W) frames for G1, G58, G105, G108, G2l9+Bo468 were retrieved from the HST archive. The cluster metallicities [Fe/H]-range from -1.8 to -0.4. Coupled with sufficiently accurate (to $\pm$0.1 mag) measures of the mean brightness of the HB-VHB-, appropriate estimates of reddening for each cluster, and the adoption of a distance modulus to M31 of (m-M)0=24.43, this has allowed us to yield a direct calibration for the mean absolute magnitude of the HB at the instability strip -- MHBV -- with varying [Fe/H]:MHBV=(0.13$\pm$0.07)[Fe/H] + (0.95$\pm$0.09), where the associated errors result from the adopted global errors in the measure and best fitting procedures. The slope of the derived relation is fully consistent with that predicted by the standard and canonical models (˜0.15) and obtained by various ground-based observations, while it is only marginally compatible with higher values (˜0.30), also obtained in the past. The zero-point, which is crucial to absolute age determinations, depends on the adopted distance to M31 and is moreover affected by an additional error due to the residual uncertainties in the HST photometric zero-points (˜0.05 mag, at least). If confirmed, such a calibration of the MHBV vs [Fe/H] relationship would imply old absolute ages (>16 Gyr) for the oldest Galactic globulars and fairly small age spread among those having a constant magnitude difference between the main-sequence turnoff and the HB.},

title = {The ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters. IX. Horizontal Branch Morphology and the Second Parameter Phenomenon},
abstract = {The horizontal branch (HB) morphology of globular clusters (GCs) is most strongly influenced by metallicity. The second parameter phenomenon acknowledges that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the HB morphology of all GCs. In particular, the outer Galactic halo contains GCs with redder HBs at a given metallicity than are found inside the Solar circle. Thus, at least a second parameter is required to characterize HB morphology. Here we analyze the median color difference between the HB and the red giant branch (RGB), d(V-I), measured from HST ACS photometry of 60 GCs within ~20 kpc of the Galactic Center. Analysis of this homogeneous data set reveals that, after the influence of metallicity has been removed, the correlation between d(V-I) and age is stronger than that of any other parameter considered. Expanding the sample to include HST photometry of the 6 most distant Galactic GCs lends additional support to the correlation between d(V-I) and age. This result is robust with respect to the adopted metallicity scale and the method of age determination, but must bear the caveat that high quality, detailed abundance information is not available for a significant fraction of the sample. When a subset of GCs with similar metallicities and ages are considered, a correlation between d(V-I) and central luminosity density is exposed. With respect to the existence of GCs with anomalously red HBs at a given metallicity, we conclude that age is the second parameter and central density is most likely the third. Important problems related to HB morphology in GCs, notably multi-modal distributions and faint blue tails, remain to be explained. (Abridged)},

abstract = {Using the MIKE spectrograph, mounted on the 6.5 m Magellan/Clay telescope at the Las Campanas observatory in Chile, we have obtained high-resolution spectra for 60 F and G dwarf stars, all likely members of a density enhancement in the local velocity distribution, referred to as the Hercules stream. Comparing with an existing sample of 102 thin and thick disk stars we have used space velocities, detailed elemental abundances, and stellar ages to trace the origin of the Hercules stream. We find that the Hercules stream stars show a wide spread in stellar ages, metallicities, and element abundances. However, the spreads are not random but separate the Hercules stream into the abundance and age trends as outlined by either the thin disk or the thick disk. We hence claim that the major part of the Hercules stream actually are thin and thick disk stars. These diverse properties of the Hercules stream point toward a dynamical origin, probably caused by the Galactic bar. However, we can at the moment not entirely rule out that the Hercules stream could be the remnants of a relatively recent merger event.},

abstract = {We present new BV time series data of the Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). Current data cover an area of ~0.3 deg2 around the center of the galaxy and allow us to identify 92 variables. Among them 75 are RR Lyrae stars, 15 are bona fide anomalous Cepheids, one might be a Galactic field RR Lyrae star, and one is located along the Carina red giant branch. Expanding upon the seminal photographic investigation by Saha, Monet, {\&} Seitzer we supply, for the first time, accurate estimates of their pulsation parameters (periods, amplitudes, mean magnitudes, and colors) on the basis of CCD photometry. Approximately 50% of both RR Lyrae stars and anomalous Cepheids are new identifications. Among the RR Lyrae sample, six objects are new candidate double-mode (RRd) variables. On the basis of their pulsation properties we estimate that two variables (V158, V182) are about 50% more massive than typical RR Lyrae stars, while the bulk of the anomalous Cepheids are roughly a factor of 2 more massive than fundamental-mode (RRab) RR Lyrae stars. This finding supports the evidence that these objects are intermediate-mass stars during central He-burning phases. We adopted three different approaches to estimate the Carina distance modulus, namely, the first-overtone blue edge method, the period-luminosity-amplitude relation, and the period-luminosity-color relation. We found DM=20.19+/-0.12, a result that agrees quite well with similar estimates based on different distance indicators. The data for Carina, together with data available in the literature, strongly support the conclusion that dSph's can barely be classified into the classical Oosterhoff dichotomy. The mean period of RRab's in Carina resembles that found for Oosterhoff type II clusters, whereas the ratio between first-overtone (RRc) pulsators and the total number of RR Lyrae stars is quite similar to that found in Oosterhoff type I clusters.

abstract = {We identify ten - seven for the first time - elements of cold halo substructure (ECHOS) in the volume within 17.5 kpc of the Sun in the inner halo of the Milky Way. Our result is based on the observed spatial and radial velocity distribution of metal-poor main sequence turnoff (MPMSTO) stars in 137 Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) lines of sight. We point out that the observed radial velocity distribution is consistent with a smooth stellar component of the Milky Way's inner halo overall, but disagrees significantly at the radial velocities that correspond to our detections. We show that all of our detections are statistically significant and that we expect no false positives. We also use our detections and completeness estimates to infer a formal upper limit of 0.34 +/- 0.02 on the fraction of the MPMSTO population in the inner halo that belong to ECHOS. Our detections and completeness calculations suggest that there is a significant population of low fractional overdensity ECHOS in the inner halo, and we predict that 1/3 of the inner halo (by volume) harbors ECHOS with MPMSTO star number densities n ~ 15 kpc^-3. ECHOS are likely older than known surface brightness substructure, so our detections provide us with a direct measure of the accretion history of the Milky Way in a region and time interval that has yet to be fully explored. In concert with previous studies, our result suggests that the level of merger activity has been roughly constant over the past few Gyr and that there has been no accretion of single stellar systems more massive than a few percent of a Milky Way mass in that interval.

title = {Computation of the distance moduli of RR Lyrae stars from their light and colour curves.},
abstract = {We use B and V data of globular cluster variables to derive a formula for the distance moduli of RRab stars. The method employs the Fourier decomposition of the V light curve and the average B-V colour index. By using our former result for the V_0_ absolute magnitude, we also obtain an expression for the dereddened colour index. With the aid of the new formulae, the relative distance moduli can be estimated within an error of <0.03mag. Although we also make an absolute calibration, it is cautioned that this may be more affected by possible systematic errors originating mostly from the Baade-Wesselink magnitudes. On the basis of the scatter of the individual distance moduli computed with and without reddening correction, it is shown that inhomogeneous reddening plays a role in several clusters. By using our formulae we derive new expressions for the I_c_ and K absolute magnitudes on a sample of stars which contains mostly field stars with accurate photometry. As a by-product of this derivation we also give optimum estimations for the selective absorption coefficient R_V_. We show that the K absolute magnitude contains important contribution also from the Fourier parameters, besides the well known dependence on the period. The I_c_ absolute magnitude is superbly correlated with the Fourier parameters, which implies that this colour is a very good candidate for the accurate estimation of the absolute magnitude.},

title = {Probing the Neutron-Capture Nucleosynthesis History of Galactic Matter},
abstract = {The heavy elements formed by neutron capture processes have an interesting history from which we can extract useful clues to and constraints upon both the characteristics of the processes themselves and the star formation and nucleosynthesis history of Galactic matter. Of particular interest in this regard are the heavy element compositions of extremely metal-deficient stars. At metallicities [Fe/H] <= -2.5, the elements in the mass region past barium (A >= 130-140 have been found (in non carbon-rich stars) to be pure r-process products. The identification of an environment provided by massive stars and associated Type II supernovae as an r-process site seems compelling. Increasing levels of heavy s-process (e.g., barium) enrichment with increasing metallicity, evident in the abundances of more metal-rich halo stars and disk stars, reflect the delayed contributions from the low- and intermediate-mass (M \~ 1-3 Msol) stars that provide the site for the main s-process nucleosynthesis component during the AGB phase of their evolution. New abundance data in the mass region 60 <~ A <~ 130 is providing insight into the identity of possible alternative r-process sites. We review recent observational studies of heavy element abundances both in low metallicity halo stars and in disk stars, discuss the observed trends in light of nucleosynthesis theory, and explore some implications of these results for Galactic chemical evolution, nucleosynthesis, and nucleocosmochronology.},

title = {Simulations of Galaxy Formation in a Λ Cold Dark Matter Universe. I. Dynamical and Photometric Properties of a Simulated Disk Galaxy},
abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the dynamical and photometric properties of a disk galaxy simulated in the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmogony. The galaxy is assembled through a number of high-redshift mergers followed by a period of quiescent accretion after z~1 that lead to the formation of two distinct dynamical components: a spheroid of mostly old stars and a rotationally supported disk of younger stars. The surface brightness profile is very well approximated by the superposition of an R1/4 spheroid and an exponential disk. Each photometric component contributes a similar fraction of the total luminosity of the system, although less than a quarter of the stars form after the last merger episode at z~1. In the optical bands the surface brightness profile is remarkably similar to that of Sab galaxy UGC 615, but the simulated galaxy rotates significantly faster and has a declining rotation curve dominated by the spheroid near the center. The decline in circular velocity is at odds with observation and results from the high concentration of the dark matter and baryonic components, as well as from the relatively high mass-to-light ratio of the stars in the simulation. The simulated galaxy lies ~1 mag off the I-band Tully-Fisher relation of late-type spirals but seems to be in reasonable agreement with Tully-Fisher data on S0 galaxies. In agreement with previous simulation work, the angular momentum of the luminous component is an order of magnitude lower than that of late-type spirals of similar rotation speed. This again reflects the dominance of the slowly rotating, dense spheroidal component, to which most discrepancies with observation may be traced. On its own, the disk component has properties rather similar to those of late-type spirals: its luminosity, its exponential scale length, and its colors are all comparable to those of galaxy disks of similar rotation speed. This suggests that a different form of feedback than adopted here is required to inhibit the efficient collapse and cooling of gas at high redshift that leads to the formation of the spheroid. Reconciling, without fine-tuning, the properties of disk galaxies with the early collapse and high merging rates characteristic of hierarchical scenarios such as ΛCDM remains a challenging, yet so far elusive, proposition.},

title = {Elemental Abundance Survey of The Galactic Thick Disk},
abstract = {[Abridged abstract] We have performed an abundance analysis for 176 F- and G- dwarfs of the Galactic thick disk component. Using accurate radial velocities combined with {\$}Hipparcos{\$} astrometry, kinematics (U, V, and W) and Galactic orbital parameters were computed. We estimate the probability for a star to belong to the thin disk, the thick disk or the halo. Abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Eu have been obtained. The abundances for thick disk stars are compared with those for thin disk members from Reddy et al. (2003). The ratios of {\$}\alpha{\$}-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti) to iron for thick disk disk stars show a clear enhancement compared to thin disk members in the range {\$}-0.3 <{\$} [Fe/H] {\$} < -1.2{\$}. There are also other elements - Al, Sc, V, Co, and possibly Zn - which show enhanced ratios to iron in the thick disk relative to the thin disk. The abundances of Na, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Cu (relative to Fe) are very similar for thin and thick disk stars. The dispersion in abundance ratios [X/Fe] at given [Fe/H] for thick disk stars is consistent with the expected scatter due to measurement errors, suggesting a lack of `cosmic' scatter. The observed compositions of the thin and thick disks seem to be consistent with models of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering in a {\$}\Lambda{\$}CDM universe. In particular, the distinct abundance patterns observed in the thin and thick disks, and the chemical homogeneity of the thick disk at different galactocentric distances favor a scenario in which the majority of thick-disk stars were formed {\it in situ}, from gas rich merging blocks.},

title = {Metallicity Analysis of MACHO Galactic Bulge RR0 Lyrae Stars from their Light Curves},
abstract = {We present metallicities of 2690 RR0 Lyrae stars observed toward the MACHO Survey fields in the Galactic bulge. These [Fe/H] values are based upon an empirically-calibrated relationship that uses the Fourier coefficients of the light curve and are accurate to $\pm$0.2 dex. The majority of the RR0 Lyrae stars in our sample are located in the Galactic bulge, but 255 RR0 stars are associated with the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy. We find that the RR0 Lyrae stars that belong to the Galactic bulge have average metallicities [Fe/H] = -1.25, with a broad metallicity range from [Fe/H] = -2.26 to -0.15. The RR0 stars from the Sgr dwarf galaxy have lower average metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.55 $\pm$ 0.02, with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.25 dex, similar to that in the bulge. A correlation between metallicity and galactocentric distance is found, in a sense that for the metal-poor RR0 Lyrae stars ([Fe/H]<-1.5 dex), the closer a star is to the Galactic center, on average, the more metal-rich it is. However, for the metal-rich RR0 Lyrae stars ([Fe/H] >-1.2 dex), this trend is reversed. Using mean magnitudes of MACHO RR Lyrae stars, we searched for the evidence of the Galactic bar and found marginal evidence of a bar. The absence of a strong bar indicates that the RR Lyrae in the bulge represent a different population than the majority of the bulge stars, which are metal-rich and are part of a bar.},

title = {A new method for determining physical parameters of fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars from multicolour light curves},
abstract = {We present a new method for determining physical parameters of RRab variables exclusively from multicolour light curves. Our method is an inverse photometric Baade-Wesselink analysis which, using a non-linear least-squares algorithm, searches for the effective temperature (Teff) and pulsational velocity (Vp) curves and other physical parameters that best fit the observed light curves, utilizing synthetic colours and bolometric corrections from static atmosphere models. The Teff and Vp curves are initially derived from empirical relations then they are varied by the fitting algorithm. The method yields the variations and the absolute values of the radius, the effective temperature, the visual brightness and the luminosity of individual objects. Distance and mass are also determined. The method is tested on nine RRab stars subjected to Baade-Wesselink analyses earlier by several authors. The physical parameters derived by our method using only the light-curve data of these stars are well within their possible ranges defined by direct Baade-Wesselink and other techniques. A new empirical relation between the IC magnitude and the pulsational velocity is also presented, which allows to construct the Vp curve of an RRab star purely from photometric observations to an accuracy of about 3.5km s-1.},

title = {Theoretical models for classical Cepheids. VII. Metallicity effects on the Cepheid distance scale},
abstract = {We use theoretical Period-Luminosity and Period-Luminosity-Color relations in the VI passbands, as based on nonlinear, nonlocal and time-dependent convective pulsating models, to predict the reddening and true distance modulus of distant Cepheids observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. By relying on the pulsating models with metal content Z=0.008, we find that the theoretical predictions agree to the values obtained by the Extragalactic Distance Scale Key Project on the basis of empirical Period-Luminosity relations referenced to LMC variables. In the meantime, from the theoretical relations with Z=0.004 and 0.02 we find that the predicted E(B-V) and mu_0 decrease as the adopted metal content increases. This suggests a metallicity correction to LMC-based distances as given by Delta mu_0 /Delta log Z ~ -0.27 mag dex-1, where Delta log Z is the difference between the metallicity of the Cepheids whose distance we are estimating and the LMC value Z=0.008. Such a theoretical correction appears supported by an existing, although weak, correlation between the Cepheid distance and the [O/H] metallicity of galaxies within a given group or cluster, as well as by a similar correlation between the H_0 estimate and the [O/H] metallicity of the galaxies which calibrate the SNIa luminosity. On the contrary, the metallicity corrections earlier suggested on empirical grounds seem to be excluded. Eventually we suggest that the average value < H_0> ~ 67 km s-1 Mpc-1 provided by the Key Project team should increase at least up to ~ 69 km s-1 Mpc-1. Further observational evidences in support of the predicted scenario are finally presented.},

abstract = {We present a new (V, B-V) color-magnitude diagram of the Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) that extends from the tip of the red giant branch (RGB) down to V~25 mag. Data were collected with the Wide Field Imager available at the 2.2 m ESO/MPI telescope and cover an area of ~0.3 deg2 around the center of the galaxy. We confirm the occurrence of a substantial number of old stars with ages around 11 Gyr, together with an intermediate-age population around 5 Gyr. Moreover, we also detected a new, well-defined blue plume of young main-sequence stars with an age, at most, on the order of 1 Gyr. This finding is further supported by the detection of a sizable sample of anomalous Cepheids, whose occurrence can be understood in terms of stars with ages ~0.6 Gyr. The evidence for such a young population appears at odds with current cosmological models, which predict that the most recent star formation episodes in dSph's should have taken place 2-3 Gyr ago. At odds with previous results available in the literature, we found that stars along the RGB of old and intermediate-age stellar populations indicate a mean metallicity roughly equal to Z=0.0004 ([Fe/H]~-1.7) and a small dispersion around this value. This finding is further strengthened by the reduced spread in luminosity of RR Lyrae and horizontal-branch stars in the old stellar population and of the red clump in the intermediate-age group. We find evidence of a smooth spatial distribution of the intermediate-age stellar population (~5 Gyr), which appears more centrally concentrated than the oldest one (~11 Gyr). The radial distribution of the old population appears more clumpy, with a peak off-center by ~2' when compared with the Carina center. Star counts show a well-defined ``shoulder'' in the northeast direction along both the minor and major axes. Current data do not allow us to assess whether this feature is the break in the slope of star-count profiles predicted by Johnston, Sigurdsson, {\&} Hernquist.

abstract = { Abridged: The golden age of astrophysics is upon us with both grand discoveries (extra-solar planets, dark matter, dark energy) and precision cosmology. Fundamental understanding of the working of stars and galaxies is within reach, thanks to newly available precision measurements. We highlight the importance of distances and model independent distances and masses.  Distances are fundamental in astrophysics and their knowledge can change our perception of phenomena dramatically: e.g., in antiquity, the Heliocentric model was rejected because the predicted stellar parallaxes were not observed.  Distance measurements are directly related to the history {\&} fate of the uni- verse as they provide 2 of 3 methods available to date the universe. The 1st method is based on the ages of stars, which can be ascertained if their lumi- nosities (distances) are accurately known. The 2nd method relies on cosmolo- gical methods. To 1st order, the age of the universe is the inverse H_0.  As stressed by the previous decadal report, "the fundamental goal of ... astrophysics is to understand how the universe ... galaxies [and] stars ... formed, how they evolved, and what their destiny will be." These questions can be answered partly by micro-arcsecond astrometry: 1) Galactic archeology: a detailed reconstruction of the formation history of the Milky Way and other Local Group galaxies, 2) the very oldest stars in the Milky Way and the age of the Universe, and 3) H_0 and concordance cosmology.  These goals are achievable by combining muas-arcsecond astrometry from the proposed SIM-Lite mission supplemented with ground-based spectroscopy. The results of our proposed project will force the biggest reassessment of stellar astrophysics in 50 years, which will affect most branches of astrophysics. },

abstract = { A sample of roughly 1,800 halo subdwarf stars with radial velocities and proper motions is assembled, using the repeated multi-band Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric measurements in Stripe 82. Our sample of halo subdwarfs is extracted via a reduced proper motion diagram and distances are obtained using photometric parallaxes, thus giving full phase space information. The tilt of the velocity ellipsoid with respect to the spherical polar coordinate system is computed and found to be consistent with zero for two of the three tilt angles, and very small for the third. We prove that if the inner halo is in a steady-state and the triaxial velocity ellipsoid is everywhere aligned in spherical polar coordinates, then the potential must be spherically symmetric. The detectable, but very mild, misalignment with spherical polars is consistent with the perturbative effects of the Galactic disk on a spherical dark halo. Banana orbits are generated at the 1:1 resonance (in horizontal and vertical frequency) by the disk. They populate Galactic potentials at the typical radii of our subdwarf sample, along with the much more dominant short-axis tubes. However, on geometric grounds alone, the tilt cannot vanish for the banana orbits and this leads to a slight, but detectable, misalignment. We argue that the tilt of the stellar halo velocity ellipsoid therefore provides a hitherto largely neglected but important line of argument that the Milky Way's dark halo, which dominates the potential, must be nearly spherical. },

title = {Observations of Thick Disks in the Hubble Space Telescope Ultra Deep Field},
abstract = {The vertical profiles of chain and spiral galaxies in the Hubble Space Telescope Ultra Deep Field (UDF) are fit to sech2(z/z0) functions convolved with stellar profiles in order to measure the disk scale heights z0 in four passbands. The bulge regions of the spiral galaxies are avoided. Photometric redshifts give absolute scales. The rms heights of the giant clumps in these galaxies are also measured. The results indicate that UDF disks are thick, with an average z0=1.0+/-0.4 kpc. The ratio of radial exponential scale length to z0 is ~3+/-1.5. The scale heights are only 20% larger than the radii of the giant star-forming clumps and a factor of ~10 larger than the rms clump deviations around the midplanes. This suggests that the clumps formed from midplane gas and dissolved to make the thick disks. Redshifted stellar population models suggest ages of ~1 Gyr and mass column densities from 4 to 40 Msolar pc-2. The UDF disks look like young versions of modern thick disks. This resemblance is difficult to understand if galaxies grow over time or if subsequent accretion of thin disks gravitationally shrinks the observed thick disks. More likely, high-redshift disks are thick because their mass column densities are low; a velocity dispersion of only 14 km s-2 reproduces the observed thickness. Modern thick disks require more heating at high redshift. This is possible if the gas that eventually makes the thin disk is in place before the youngest age of a modern thick disk, and if the existing stars are heated during the delivery of this gas.},

We use this unique material to analyze the behavior of interstellar extinction and to trace the detailed structure of the Third Galactic Quadrant (TGQ).We find that the Outer (Cygnus) grand design spiral arm is traced by stellar and CO components while the Perseus arm is traced solely by CO and is possibly being disrupted by the crossing of the Local (Orion) arm. The Local arm is traced by CO and young stars toward l = 240 degrees and extends for over 8 kpc along the line of sight reaching the Outer arm. Finally, we characterize the Galactic warp and compare the geometries implied by the young stellar and CO components.},

The Color-Magnitude Diagram synthesis method is well established as the most accurate way to determine star formation history of galaxies back to the earliest times. This approach received a large boost from the exceptional data sets that wide field CCD imagers on the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope could provide. Spectroscopic studies using large ground based telescopes such as VLT, Magellan, Keck and HET have allowed the determination of abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies. These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations can vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to theories of galaxy formation and evolution. The combination of spectroscopy and imaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy formation and evolution is the aim of this review.},

title = {Star Counts Redivivus. IV. Density Laws through Photometric Parallaxes},
abstract = {In an effort to more precisely define the spatial distribution of Galactic field stars, we present an analysis of the photometric parallaxes of stars in seven Kapteyn selected areas. Our photometry database covers ~14.9 deg2 and contains over 130,000 stars, of which approximately 70,000 are in a color range (0.4<=R-I<=1.5) for which relatively unambiguous photometric parallaxes can be derived. We discuss our photometry pipeline, our method of determining photometric parallaxes, and our analysis efforts. We also address the affects of Malmquist bias, subgiant/giant contamination, metallicity, and binary stars upon the derived density laws. The affect of binary stars is the most significant of these biases-a binary star fraction of 50% could result in derived scale heights that are 80% of the actual values. We find that while the disklike populations of the Milky Way are easily constrained in a simultaneous analysis of all seven fields, no good simultaneous solution for the halo is found. We have applied halo density laws taken from other studies and find that the Besan{\c c}on flattened power-law halo model (c/a=0.6,ρ~r-2.75) produces the best fit to our data. With this halo, the thick disk has a scale height of 750 pc with an 8.5% normalization to the old disk. The old-disk scale height is ~280-300 pc for our early-type (5.8<=MR<6.8) dwarfs and rises to ~ 350 pc for our late-type (8.8<=MR<=10.2) dwarf stars. Corrected for a binary fraction of 50%, these scale heights are 940 and 350-375 pc, respectively. Even with this model, there are systematic discrepancies between the observed and predicted density distributions-discrepancies apparent only at the faint magnitudes reached by our survey. Specifically, our model produces density overpredictions in the inner Galaxy and density underpredictions in the outer Galaxy. A possible escape from this dilemma is offered by modeling the stellar halo as a two-component system, as favored by studies of blue horizontal branch/RR Lyrae stars and recent analyses of the kinematics of metal-poor stars. In this paradigm, the halo has a flattened inner distribution and a roughly spherical but substructured outer distribution. Further reconciliation could be provided by a flared thick disk, a structure consistent with a merger origin for that population.},

title = {The Konkoly Blazhko Survey: Is light-curve modulation a common property of RRab stars?},
abstract = {A systematic survey to establish the true incidence rate of the Blazhko modulation among short-period, fundamental-mode, Galactic field RR Lyrae stars has been accomplished. The Konkoly Blazhko Survey (KBS) was initiated in 2004. Since then more than 750 nights of observation have been devoted to this project. A sample of 30 RRab stars was extensively observed, and light-curve modulation was detected in 14 cases. The 47% occurrence rate of the modulation is much larger than any previous estimate. The significant increase of the detected incidence rate is mostly due to the discovery of small-amplitude modulation. Half of the Blazhko variables in our sample show modulation with so small amplitude that definitely have been missed in the previous surveys. We have found that the modulation can be very unstable in some cases, e.g. RY Com showed regular modulation only during one part of the observations while during two seasons it had stable light curve with abrupt, small changes in the pulsation amplitude. This type of light-curve variability is also hard to detect in other Survey's data. The larger frequency of the light-curve modulation of RRab stars makes it even more important to find the still lacking explanation of the Blazhko phenomenon. The validity of the [Fe/H](P,phi_{31}) relation using the mean light curves of Blazhko variables is checked in our sample. We have found that the formula gives accurate result for small-modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars, and this is also the case for large-modulation-amplitude stars if the light curve has complete phase coverage. However, if the data of large-modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars are not extended enough (e.g. < 500 data points from < 15 nights), the formula may give false result due to the distorted shape of the mean light curve used.},

title = {High-Resolution Spectroscopy of Extremely Metal-Poor Stars in the Least  Evolved Galaxies: Ursa Major II and Coma Berenices},
abstract = { We present Keck/HIRES observations of six metal-poor stars in two of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, Ursa Major II and Coma Berenices. These observations include the first high-resolution spectroscopic observations of extremely metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-3.0) stars not belonging to the Milky Way (MW) halo field star population. We obtain abundance measurements and upper limits for 26 elements between carbon and europium. The entire sample of stars spans a range of -3.2<[Fe/H]<-2.3, and we confirm that each galaxy contains a large intrinsic spread of Fe abundances. A comparison with MW halo stars of similar metallicities reveals substantial agreement between the abundance patterns of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and the MW halo for the light, alpha and iron-peak elements (C to Zn). This agreement contrasts with the results of earlier studies of more metal-rich stars (-2.5<[Fe/H]<-1.0) in more luminous dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), which found significant abundance discrepancies with respect to the MW halo data. The abundances of neutron-capture elements (Sr to Eu) in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are extremely low, consistent with the most metal-poor halo stars, but not with the typical halo abundance pattern at [Fe/H]>-3.0. Our results are broadly consistent with a galaxy formation model that predicts that massive dwarf galaxies are the source of the metal-rich component ([Fe/H]>-2.5) of the MW halo, but we also suggest that the faintest known dwarfs may be the primary contributors to the metal-poor end of the MW halo metallicity distribution. },

abstract = {Based on a deep optical CCD (UBV(RI)_C) photometric survey and on the Two-Micron All-Sky-Survey (2MASS) data we derived the main parameters of the open cluster NGC 2401. We found this cluster is placed at 6.3 {\$}\pm{\$} 0.5 kpc (V_O - M_V = 14.0 \pm 0.2) from the Sun and is 25 Myr old, what allows us to identify NGC 2401 as a member of the young population belonging to the innermost side of the extension of the Norma-Cygnus spiral-arm in the Third Galactic Quadrant. A spectroscopic study of the emission star LSS 440 that lies in the cluster area revealed it is a B0Ve star; however, we could not confirm it is a cluster member. We also constructed the cluster luminosity function (LF) down to {\$}V \sim 22{\$} and the cluster initial mass function (IMF) for all stars with masses above {\$}M \sim 1-2 M_{\sun}{\$}. It was found that the slope of the cluster IMF is {\$}x \approx 1.8 \pm 0.2{\$}. The presence of a probable PMS star population associated to the cluster is weakly revealed.},

title = {The Halo of the Milky Way},
abstract = {We show that the star counts in the spheroid of the Milky Way are not symmetric about the l=0, l=180 deg. plane. The minimum counts are found towards l=155 deg. The Galactic longitude of maximum star counts depends on the magnitude and color selection of the halo stars. We interpret this as evidence that the spheroid population is triaxial with a major axis oriented 65 deg from the line of sight from the Sun to the Galactic center, and approximately perpendicular to the Galactic bar. Large local star concentrations from tidal debris and possible tidal debris are also observed. A full understanding of the Galactic spheroid population awaits position information and three dimensional space velocities for a representative set of stars in every substructure. Tangential velocities for many stars will be provided by current and planned astrometry missions, but no planned mission will measure stars faint enough to unravel the more distant parts of the spheroid, which contain the majority of the spatial substructure.

title = {Two-component model for the chemical evolution of the Galactic disk},
abstract = {In the present paper, we introduce a two-component model of the Galactic disk to investigate its chemical evolution. It is assumed that the formation of the thick and thin disks occurs in two main accretion episodes with both infall rates being Gaussian. Both the pre-thin and post-thin scenarios for the formation of the thick disk are considered. The best fit is obtained through chi (2) -test between the models and the new observed metallicity distribution function of G dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood (Hou et al. 1998). Our results show that, the predictions of both the pre-thin and post-thin model agree well with the new observed G-dwarf metallicity distribution, i.e., it is difficult to conclude which one is better when based on current observational constraints. However, the present-day local density of the thick disk, required for the pre-thin model to get the best fit, is larger than most of results from star counts, yet this disagreement does not exist for the post-thin model. From this point of view, it would seem that the post-thin model is more viable. Finally, other comparisons between model predictions and observations are given.},

We generate artificial DIVA, FAME and GAIA halo catalogues, in which we look for the signatures left by the accreted satellites. We develop a method based on the standard Friends-of-Friends algorithm applied to the space of integrals of motion. We find this simple method can recover about 50per cent of the different accretion events, when the observational uncertainties expected for GAIA are taken into account, even when the exact form of the Galactic potential is unknown. The recovery rate for DIVA and FAME is much smaller, but these missions, like GAIA, should be able to test the hierarchical formation paradigm on our Galaxy by measuring the amount of halo substructure in the form of nearby kinematically cold streams with, for example, a two-point correlation function in velocity space.},

We have obtained V, B-V and V, V-I color-magnitude diagrams that reach V~23.0-23.2 mag showing the galaxy turnoff at V~21.7 mag, and have performed the first study of the variable star population of this new Milky Way companion. Two RR Lyrae stars (a fundamental-mode -RRab- and a first overtone -RRc- pulsator) and a short period variable with period P=0.12468 days were identified in the galaxy. The RRab star has a rather long period of P_ab=0.66971 days and is about 0.2 mag brighter than the RRc variable and other non-variable stars on the galaxy horizontal branch. In the period-amplitude diagram the RRab variable falls closer to the loci of Oosterhoff type-II systems and evolved fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic globular cluster M3. The average apparent magnitude of the galaxy horizontal branch, <V_HB>=18.64+-0.04 mag, leads to a distance modulus for the Coma dSph mu_0=18.13+-0.08 mag, corresponding to a distance d=42^{+2}_{-1} kpc, by adopting a reddening E(B-V) = 0.045 +- 0.015 mag and a metallicity [Fe/H]=-2.53 +- 0.05 dex. },

However, very little is known about the enrichment of the ultra-faint systems recently discovered in large numbers in large sky surveys. Current low-resolution spectroscopy and photometric data indicate that these galaxies are highly dark matter dominated and predominantly metal poor. On the other hand, recent high-resolution abundance analyses indicate that some dwarf galaxies experienced highly inhomogenous chemical enrichment, where star formation proceeds locally on small scales. In this article, I will review the kinematic and chemical abundance information of the Milky Way satellite dSphs that is presently available from low- and high resolution spectroscopy. Moreover, some of the most peculiar element and inhomogeneous enrichment patterns will be discussed and related to the question of to what extent the faintest dSph candidates could have contributed to the Galactic halo, compared to more luminous systems.},

title = {An Oosterhoff Analysis of the Galactic Bulge Field RR Lyrae stars: Implications On Their Absolute Magnitudes},
abstract = {We present an analysis of the period-{\$}V{\$}-amplitude plane for RR0 Lyrae stars (fundamental mode pulsators) with "normal" light curves in the bulge using the MACHO bulge fields. Although bulge globular clusters have RR Lyraes that divide into two reasonable distinct groups according to the average period of the RR0 Lyraes (Oosterhoff 1939), there is no evidence of a gap between Oosterhoff I and II stars in the bulge field star sample. The majority of the bulge RR0 Lyrae field star population have a difference in period compared to the Oosterhoff I cluster M3 (Delta log P) that is shifted by about 0.02 days with regard to the Milky Way Oosterhoff I population, and the sample includes stars with Delta log P > 0.06 days, a characteristic hardly seen in Milky Way globular clusters. The metal-rich RR0 Lyrae stars in the Galactic bulge sample have Delta log P values on the other side of the spectrum as those in the metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. We find that the {\$}V{\$}-amplitude for a given period is a function of Delta log P, and not of metal abundance, similar to the result found by Clement {\&} Shelton (1999) for RR Lyrae stars in Milky Way globular clusters. A comparative study of the bulge field stars with similar metallicities but different Oosterhoff types is carried out. Bulge field RR0 Lyrae variables with Delta log P values similar to Oosterhoff II clusters are about 0.2 mag brighter than RR0 Lyrae variables with Delta log P similar to Oosterhoff I clusters. Reliance upon a single absolute magnitude-[Fe/H] relation may be inappropriate when considering populations with different Delta log P.},

abstract = { We study the orbital properties of stars in four (published) simulations of thick disks formed by: i) accretion from disrupted satellites, ii) heating of a pre-existing thin disk by a minor merger, iii) radial migration and iv) gas rich mergers. We find that the distribution of orbital eccentricities are predicted to be different for each model: a prominent peak at low eccentricity is expected for the heating, migration and gas-rich merging scenarios, while the eccentricity distribution is broader and shifted towards higher values for the accretion model. These differences can be traced back to whether the bulk of the stars in each case is formed 'in-situ' or is 'accreted', and are robust to the peculiarities of each model. A simple test based on the eccentricity distribution of nearby thick disk stars may thus help elucidate the dominant formation mechanism of the Galactic thick disk. },

In an investigation of the use of Be as a cosmochronometer and of its evolution in the Galaxy, we found evidence that in a log(Be/H) vs. [alpha/Fe] diagram the halo stars separate into two components. One is consistent with predictions of evolutionary models while the other is chemically indistinguishable from the thick-disk stars. This is interpreted as a difference in the star formation history of the two components and suggests that the local halo is not a single uniform population where a clear age-metallicity relation can be defined. We also found evidence that the star formation rate was lower in the outer regions of the thick disk, pointing towards an inside-out formation.},

abstract = {We describe a high-precision, deep (to V~19-21), absolute proper-motion survey that samples ~50 lines of sight in the Kapteyn selected areas along declination zones -15$\,^{\circ}$, 0$\,^{\circ}$, and 15$\,^{\circ}$. In many fields the astrometric baseline reaches nearly a century. We demonstrate that these data provide typical per star precisions between ~1 and 3 mas yr-1 to the above magnitude limits, with the absolute reference frame established by numerous extragalactic sources in each survey field. Combined with existing and ongoing photometric and radial velocity surveys in these fields, these astrometric data will enable, among other things, accurate detailed dynamical modeling of satellite interactions with our Galaxy. In this contribution we describe the astrometric part of our survey and show preliminary results along the trailing tail of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and in the Monoceros Ring region.},

abstract = {We present observations of RR Lyrae variables in the Local Group late-type spiral galaxy M33. Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope, we have identified 64 ab-type RR Lyraes in M33. We have estimated reddenings for these stars based on their minimum light V-I colors and metallicities based on their periods. From the distributions of these properties, we conclude that the RR Lyraes belong to two populations - one associated with the halo of M33 and the other with its disk. Given that RR Lyraes are produced by populations older than ~10 Gyr, this suggests that not only does the field halo of M33 contain an old component, but so does its disk. This is one of the best pieces of evidence for the existence of a halo field component in M33. Using a relation between RR Lyrae absolute magnitude and metallicity (Mv(RR) = 0.23[Fe/H] + 0.93), we estimate a mean distance modulus of <(m-M)o> = 24.67 +/- 0.08 for M33. This places M33 approximately 70 kpc beyond M31 in line-of-sight distance.},

We are able to show for a few idealised gravitational potentials that these features are preserved also in systems that have evolved strongly in time. Furthermore, this time evolution is imprinted in the distribution of streams in frequency space. We have also tested the power of the orbital frequencies in a fully self-consistent (live) N-body simulation of the merger between a disk galaxy and a massive satellite. Even in this case streams can be easily identified and the time of accretion of the satellite can be accurately estimated.},

title = {Fitting a Galactic Model to an All-Sky Survey},
abstract = {We use star counts from the APS Catalog of the POSS I to develop a Galactic model optimized for large, statistically significant data sets uniformly distributed over the sky. The power of the APS Catalog for Galactic structure studies comes from its large sky coverage, individual photometric calibrations, adequate scanning resolution, statistically significant sample sizes, color information, and, most importantly, multidirectional sampling. The APS Catalog is an extremely useful exploratory data set but requires new methodologies to maximize its usefulness. We have selected an 88-field subset, 16 deg2 each, from the catalog for a program of magnitude-limited star counts (12 <= O [blue] <= 20) within the completeness limit of the survey and in a realm where star-galaxy classification has minimal effects on the results. We have developed a simple three-component (disk, halo, thick disk) model optimized for efficiently and objectively analyzing star-count information. Our model not only produces model counts for our multidirectional data, but also returns a ``goodness of fit'' statistic. We use a genetic algorithm, a robust optimization technique well suited for this large multidirectional and multiple-parameter study, to optimize the fit and derive a self-consistent set of global parameters to model the Galaxy. With this global fit, we can identify significant deviations from symmetry in the Galaxy's large-scale distribution of stars. The results from 12 independent executions or trials yielded consistent results. All of the model fits produced a flattened inner halo with c/a~0.5-0.6. The radial scale length of the disk, ~3.5 kpc, is higher than found in recent infrared surveys but agrees with older optical studies. The density normalizations to the plane for the thick disk and halo are consistent with previous work. Our model results all yielded a scale height for the thick disk of ~900 pc. The most surprising results from these global fits are relatively high values (>4 kpc) for the de Vaucouleurs radius for the halo and the radial scale length of the thick disk. The radial scale length for the thick disk is significantly larger than that for the old/thin disk and, if confirmed with additional work, may imply an independent origin for the thick disk. We also present evidence that the scale height and normalization of the thick disk may be variable with direction.},

title = {Nucleosynthesis Clocks and the Age of the Galaxy},
abstract = {Nucleocosmochronology involves the use of the abundances of radioactive nuclear species and their radiogenic decay daughters to establish the finite age of the elements and the time scale for their formation. While there exist radioactive products of several specific nucleosynthesis mechanisms that can reveal the histories of these mechanisms, it is the long lived actinide isotopes {232}Th, {235}U, and {238}U, formed in the r-process, that currently play the major role in setting the time scale of Galactic nucleosynthesis. Age determinations in the context of Galactic chemical evolution studies are constrained by intrinsic model uncertainties. Recent studies have rather taken the alternative approach of dating individual stars. Thorium/europium dating of field halo stars and globular cluster stars yields ages on the order of 15 +/- 4 Gyr. A solid lower limit on stellar ages is available as well, for stars for which one both knows the thorium abundance and has an upper limit on the uranium abundance. For the cases of the two extremely metal deficient field halo stars CS 22892-052 and HD 115444, lower limits on the nuclear age of Galactic matter lie in the range 10-11 Gyr. Th/U dating of the star CS 31082-00 gives an age of 12.5 +/- 3 Gyr. Observations of thorium and uranium abundances in globular cluster stars should make possible nuclear determinations of the ages of clusters that can be compared with ages from conventional stellar evolution considerations.},

title = {Tracing Out the Northern Tidal Stream of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy},
abstract = {The main aim of this paper is to report two new detections of tidal debris in the northern stream of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy located at 45$\,^{\circ}$ and 55$\,^{\circ}$ from the center of the galaxy. Our observational approach is based on deep color-magnitude diagrams that provide accurate distances, surface brightness, and the properties of stellar population of the studied region of this tidal stream. The derived distances for these tidal debris wraps are 45+/-5 and 62+/-6 kpc, respectively. These detections are also strong observational evidence that the tidal stream discovered by the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey is tidally stripped material from the Sagittarius dwarf and support the idea that the tidal stream completely enwraps the Milky Way in an almost polar orbit. We also confirm these detections by running numerical simulations of the Sagittarius dwarf plus the Milky Way. This model reproduces the present position and velocity of the Sagittarius main body and presents a long tidal stream formed by tidal interaction with the Milky Way potential. The tidal streams of the model traces the last orbit of Sagittarius and confirms our observational detections. This model is also in good agreement with the available observations of the Sagittarius tidal stream. The comparison of our model with the positions and distances of two nonidentified halo overdensities discovered by the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey and the QUEST survey shows that they are actually associated with the trailing arm of the Sagittarius tidal stream. In addition, we identify the proper-motion group discovered by Arnold {\&} Gilmore as a piece of the Sagittarius northern stream. We also present a method for estimating the shape of the Milky Way halo potential using numerical simulations. From our simulations we obtain an oblateness of the Milky Way dark halo potential of 0.85, using the current database of distances and radial velocities of the Sagittarius tidal stream. The color-magnitude diagram of the apocenter of Sagittarius shows that this region of the stream shares the complex star formation history observed in the main body of the galaxy. We present the first evidence for a gradient in the stellar population along the stream, possibly correlated with its different pericenter passages.},

title = {Building up the stellar halo of the Galaxy},
abstract = {We study numerical simulations of satellite galaxy disruption in a potential resembling that of the Milky Way. Our goal is to assess whether a merger origin for the stellar halo would leave observable fossil structure in the phase-space distribution of nearby stars. We show how mixing of disrupted satellites can be quantified using a coarse-grained entropy. Although after 10Gyr few obvious asymmetries remain in the distribution of particles in configuration space, strong correlations are still present in velocity space. We give a simple analytic description of these effects, based on a linearized treatment in action-angle variables, which shows how the kinematic and density structure of the debris stream changes with time. By applying this description we find that a single dwarf elliptical-like satellite of current luminosity 10^8L_solar disrupted 10Gyr ago from an orbit circulating in the inner halo (mean apocentre ~12kpc) would contribute about ~30 kinematically cold streams with internal velocity dispersions below 5kms^-1 to the local stellar halo. If the whole stellar halo were built by such disrupted satellites, it should consist locally of 300-500 such streams. Clear detection of all these structures would require a sample of a few thousand stars with 3D velocities accurate to better than 5kms^-1. Even with velocity errors several times worse than this, the expected clumpiness should be quite evident. We apply our formalism to a group of stars detected near the North Galactic Pole, and derive an order-of-magnitude estimate for the initial properties of the progenitor system.},

title = {The Sphericalization of Dark Matter Halos by Galaxy Disks},
abstract = {Cosmological simulations indicate that cold dark matter (CDM) halos should be triaxial. Verifying observationally this theoretical prediction is, however, less than straightforward because the assembly of galaxies is expected to modify the halo shapes and to render them more axisymmetric. We use a suite of N-body simulations to investigate quantitatively the effect of the growth of a central disk galaxy on the shape of triaxial dark matter halos. As expected, the halo responds to the presence of the disk by becoming more spherical. The net effect depends only weakly on the orientation of the disk relative to the halo principal axes or the timescale of disk assembly, but strongly on the overall gravitational importance of the disk. Our results show that exponential disks whose contribution peaks at less than ~50% of their circular velocity are unable to modify noticeably the shape of the gravitational potential of their surrounding halos. Many dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies are expected to be in this regime, and therefore their detailed kinematics could be used to probe halo triaxiality, one of the basic predictions of the CDM paradigm. We argue that the complex disk kinematics of the dwarf galaxy NGC 2976 might be the reflection of a triaxial halo. Such signatures of halo triaxiality should be common in galaxies where the luminous component is subdominant.},

title = {The metallicities and kinematics of RR Lyrae variables, 1: New observations of local stars},
abstract = {In order to study the structure and formation history of the galaxy, we have obtained low-to-moderate dispersion spectra of 302 nearby RR Lyrae variables of Bailey type 'ab'. We derived abundances, typically accurate to 0.15-0.20 dex and calibrated to the Zinn {\&} West (1984) globular cluster metallicity scale, from the pseudoequivalent widths of the Ca II K, H delta, H gamma, and H beta lines. Radial velocities accurate to between 2 and 30 km/s were obtained from the spectra and from the literature. Distances accurate to between 5% and 20% were derived from published apparent magnitudes and Burstein {\&} Heiles (1982) reddenings. The metallicity distribution of the RR Lyrae stars peaks at (Fe/H)K approximately equals -1.5, and is narrower than that of the Ryan {\&} Norris (1991) subdwarfs, as expected since the most metal-rich and metal-poor progenitors preferentially appear as stable red and blue horizontal branch stars, rather than as RR Lyrae. The metal-rich tail of the RR Lyrae distribution extends to (Fe/H)K approximately equals 0, and a qualitative analysis of the distribution of distances from the galactic plane shows that the stars in this tail (i.e., (Fe/H)K greater than -1.0) are more concentrated to the plane than the more metal-poor stars. The abundance distribution of the local RR Lyrae stars is in excellent agreement with the changing abundance distributions of distant RR Lyrae stars as a function of galactocentric distance, as derived by Suntzeff et al. (1991), who ascribed this change to systematic variation in horizontal branch morphology (probably age variations) with galactocentric distance. The abundance distribution of the local RR Lyrae stars also agrees well with those of the distant RR Lyrae stars as a function of distance from the galactic plane. There is no evidence for an abundance gradient in this direction, suggesting that gaseous dissipation did not play a major role in the formation of the outer halo.},

title = {The Emergence of the Thick Disk in a CDM Universe. II. Colors and Abundance Patterns},
abstract = {The recently emerging conviction that thick disks are prevalent in disk galaxies, and their seemingly ubiquitous old ages, means that the formation of the thick disk, perhaps more than any other component, holds the key to unravelling the evolution of the Milky Way, and indeed all disk galaxies. In Paper I, we proposed that the thick disk was formed in an epoch of gas-rich mergers at high redshift. This hypothesis was based on comparing N-body SPH simulations to a variety of Galactic and extragalactic observations, including stellar kinematics, ages, and chemical properties. Here we examine our thick-disk formation scenario in light of the most recent observations of extragalactic thick disks. In agreement, our simulated thick disks are old and relatively metal rich, with V-I colors that do not vary significantly with distance from the plane. Furthermore, we show that our proposal results in an enhancement of α-elements in thick-disk stars as compared with thin-disk stars, consistent with observations of the relevant populations of the Milky Way. We also find that our scenario naturally leads to the formation of an old, metal-weak, stellar halo population with high α-element abundances.},

title = {Halo streams in the 7th SDSS data release},
abstract = { We have detected stellar halo streams in the solar neighborhood using data from the 7th public data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which includes the directed stellar program SEGUE: Sloan Extension For Galactic Understanding and Exploration. In order to derive distances to each star, we used the metallicity-dependent photometric parallax relation from Ivezic et al. (2008) for which we examine and quantify the accuracy. Our final sample consists of 22,321 nearby (d < 2 kpc), metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -0.5) main-sequence stars with 6D estimates of position and space velocity. We characterize the orbits of these stars through suitable kinematic proxies for their "effective" integrals of motion, angular momentum, eccentricity, and orbital polar angle and compare the observed distribution to expectations from a smooth distribution in four [Fe/H] bins. On this basis we identify at least five significant "phase-space overdensities" of stars on very similar orbits in the solar neighborhood to which we can assign unambiguously peaked [Fe/H] distributions. Three of them have been identified previously, including the halo stream discovered by Helmi et al. (1999) at a significance level of 12.0. In addition, we find at least two new genuine halo streams, judged by their kinematics and [Fe/H], at significance levels of 2.9 and 4.8, respectively. For one stream the stars even show coherence in configuration space, matching a spatial overdensity of stars found by Juric et al. (2008) at (R,z) \approx (9.5,0.8) kpc. Our results demonstrate the practical power of our search method to detect substructure in the phase-space distribution of nearby stars without making a-priori assumptions about the detailed form of the gravitational potential. },

title = {The globular cluster system of the galaxy. III - Measurements of radial velocity and metallicity for 60 clusters and a compilation of metallicities for 121 clusters},
abstract = {Spectrograms (121 A mm `)have been obtained of 60 galactic globular clusters and of three globular clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The radial velocities measured from these spectrograms by the cross-correlation technique have an accuracy of +20 km and are in good agreement with most previous measurements. They support Shawl, Hesser, and Meyer's conclusion that some of Mayall's measurements for southern clusters are substantially in error. The pseudoequivalent widths of the hydrogen lines H , Hy, and H and the Ca ii K line (K), the Ci band (Ci) and the Mg I b lines (Mg) have been measured. Most galactic globular clusters have very similar H line strengths, but the lines of four clusters (NOC 6535, 6642, 6717, and 7099 [M30]) are unusually strong. This peculiarity of NCiC 7099 had been noted earlier by Rabin, who speculated that it is related to the color gradient in the cluster. Our spectroscopic observations of two regions offset from the center of NCiC 7099 confirm Rabin's suggestion. It is not known whether the other strong-lined clusters possess similar color and H line gradients or are more homogeneous. The K, Ci, and Mg pseudo-equivalent widths correlate very well with each other and' with the photometric integrated light index Q39. The relationships between Q39 and these widths have been used to transform them into equivalent values of Q39. For the 14 clusters that had not been included in Paper I, values of E( B - V) have been estimated from their apparent B - V colors and the relationship between Q39 and (B-V)0. The metallicity ranking provided by Q39 has been compared with ones in the literature that are based on observations of individual cluster stars (i.e., the analyses of high-dispersion echelle spectrograms of red giants, measures of giant-branch effective temperature, S measurements of RR Lyrae variables, and spectrophotometry or photometry of red giants). These comparisons, which involve 50 clusters, indicate that Q39 is able to rank clusters with a precision of +0.15 in [Fe/H], which is close to that attained by the best of these other methods. It appears that Q39 is not affected much by the variation in horizontal-branch morphology that exists among clusters of similar metallicity. For 121 galactic globular clusters, the metallicities derived from observations of individual stars, the integrated light, or both, have been placed on Cohen's new metallicity scale. The values obtained for the most metal-rich and metal-poor clusters by extrapolating the scale are [Fe/H] = +0.24 and -2.58, respectively.

title = {Maps of Dust Infrared Emission for Use in Estimation of Reddening and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Foregrounds},
abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 mu m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mu m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mu m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mu m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mu m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mu m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mu m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mu m (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mu m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

Evidence shows that the period-color and period-luminosity (P-L) relations for population I Cepheids in the Galaxy and in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds have different slopes and zero points. This greatly complicates use of Cepheids for the extragalactic distance scale. Strategies are discussed to patch the problem. A consensus exists for the long distance scale for RR Lyrae stars whose calibrations favor MV(RR) = 0.52 at [Fe/H] = -1.5. Exceptions exist for "second parameter" clusters where the variation of the morphology of the horizontal branch with metallicity is anomalous, the most blatant being NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. The status and calibrations of ABH1 and AC show that different evolutionary paths and masses explain the difference P-L relations for them. AC appear predominantly in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but are almost absent in Galactic globular clusters. AHB1 stars are absent in dwarf spheroidals but are present in globular clusters. The difference may be used to study the formation of the remote Galactic halo if it is partially made by tidal disruption of companion dwarf spheroidals.},

title = {Early galaxy evolution from deep wide field star counts. I. The spheroid density law and mass function},
abstract = {As part of a global analysis of deep star counts to constrain scenarii of galaxy formation and evolution, we investigate possible links between the galactic spheroid and the dark matter halo. A wide set of deep star counts at high and intermediate galactic latitudes is used to determine the large scale density law of the spheroid. Assuming a power density law, the exponent, flattening, local density and IMF slope of this population are estimated. The estimation is checked for robustness against contamination of star counts by the thick disc population. Contamination effects are derived from a model of population synthesis under a broad variety of thick disc parameters. The parameter fit is based on a maximum likelihood criterion. The best fit spheroid density law has a flattening of 0.76, a power index of 2.44. There is a significant degeneracy between these two parameters. The data are also compatible with a slightly less flattened spheroid (c/a = 0.85), in combination with a larger power index (2.75). A flatter spheroid (c/a = 0.6) with a power index of 2 is not excluded either. We also constrain the spheroid IMF slope alpha to be 1.9 +/- 0.2, leading to a local density of 1.64 10-4 stars pc-3 and a mass density of 4.15 10-5 Msun pc-3. With this slope the expected mass density of brown dwarfs in the halo makes a negligible part of the dark matter halo, as already estimated from microlensing surveys. So, as star count data progresses in depth and extent, the picture of the spheroid star population that comes out points to a shape quite compatible with what we know about the distribution of baryonic dark matter if it is made of stellar remnants, suggesting a common dynamical origin.},

title = {Mapping the Stellar Structure of the Milky Way Thick Disk and Halo Using SEGUE Photometry},
abstract = {We map the stellar structure of the Galactic thick disk and halo by applying color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting to photometric data from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey. The SEGUE imaging scans allow, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of Milky Way structure at both high and low latitudes using uniform Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry. Incorporating photometry of all relevant stars simultaneously, CMD fitting bypasses the need to choose single tracer populations. Using old stellar populations of differing metallicities as templates, we obtain a sparse three-dimensional map of the stellar mass distribution at |Z|>1 kpc. Fitting a smooth Milky Way model comprising exponential thin and thick disks and an axisymmetric power-law halo allows us to constrain the structural parameters of the thick disk and halo. The thick-disk scale height and length are well constrained at 0.75 $\pm$ 0.07 kpc and 4.1 $\pm$ 0.4 kpc, respectively. We find a stellar halo flattening within ~25 kpc of c/a = 0.88 $\pm$ 0.03 and a power-law index of 2.75 $\pm$ 0.07 (for 7 kpc lsimRGC <~ 30 kpc). The model fits yield thick-disk and stellar halo densities at the solar location of ρthick,sun = 10-2.3$\pm$0.1 M sun pc-3 and ρhalo,sun = 10-4.20$\pm$0.05 M sun pc-3, averaging over any substructures. Our analysis provides the first clear in situ evidence for a radial metallicity gradient in the Milky Way's stellar halo: within R <~ 15 kpc the stellar halo has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] ~= -1.6, which shifts to [Fe/H] ~= -2.2 at larger radii, in line with the two-component halo deduced by Carollo et al. from a local kinematic analysis. Subtraction of the best-fit smooth and symmetric model from the overall density maps reveals a wealth of substructures at all latitudes, some attributable to known streams and overdensities, and some new. A simple warp cannot account for the low latitude substructure, as overdensities occur simultaneously above and below the Galactic plane.},

title = {The Milky Way Tomography with SDSS. I. Stellar Number Density Distribution},
abstract = {Using the photometric parallax method we estimate the distances to ~48 million stars detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and map their three-dimensional number density distribution in the Galaxy. The currently available data sample the distance range from 100 pc to 20 kpc and cover 6500 deg2 of sky, mostly at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>25). These stellar number density maps allow an investigation of the Galactic structure with no a priori assumptions about the functional form of its components. The data show strong evidence for a Galaxy consisting of an oblate halo, a disk component, and a number of localized overdensities. The number density distribution of stars as traced by M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (D<2 kpc) is well fit by two exponential disks (the thin and thick disk) with scale heights and lengths, bias corrected for an assumed 35% binary fraction, of H1=300 pc and L1=2600 pc, and H2=900 pc and L2=3600 pc, and local thick-to-thin disk density normalization ρthick(Rsolar)/ρthin(Rsolar)=12%. We use the stars near main-sequence turnoff to measure the shape of the Galactic halo. We find a strong preference for oblate halo models, with best-fit axis ratio c/a=0.64, ρH~r-2.8 power-law profile, and the local halo-to-thin disk normalization of 0.5%. Based on a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the errors of derived model parameters not to be larger than ~20% for the disk scales and ~10% for the density normalization, with largest contributions to error coming from the uncertainty in calibration of the photometric parallax relation and poorly constrained binary fraction. While generally consistent with the above model, the measured density distribution shows a number of statistically significant localized deviations. In addition to known features, such as the Monoceros stream, we detect two overdensities in the thick disk region at cylindrical galactocentric radii and heights (R,Z)~(6.5,1.5) kpc and (R,Z)~(9.5,0.8) kpc and a remarkable density enhancement in the halo covering over 1000 deg2 of sky toward the constellation of Virgo, at distances of ~6-20 kpc. Compared to counts in a region symmetric with respect to the l=0deg line and with the same Galactic latitude, the Virgo overdensity is responsible for a factor of 2 number density excess and may be a nearby tidal stream or a low-surface brightness dwarf galaxy merging with the Milky Way. The u-g color distribution of stars associated with it implies metallicity lower than that of thick disk stars and consistent with the halo metallicity distribution. After removal of the resolved overdensities, the remaining data are consistent with a smooth density distribution; we detect no evidence of further unresolved clumpy substructure at scales ranging from ~50 pc in the disk to ~1-2 kpc in the halo.},

We identify 655 BHB stars in this non-kinematically selected sample. We calculate the luminosity function of field BHB stars, and find evidence for very few hot BHB stars in the field. The BHB stars located at a distance from the Galactic plane |Z| < 4 kpc trace what is clearly a metal-weak thick disk population, with a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.7, a rotation velocity gradient of dvrot/d|Z| = -28 $\pm$ 3.4 km s-1 in the region |Z| < 6 kpc, and a density scale height of hZ = 1.26 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc. The BHB stars located at 5 < |Z| < 9 kpc are a predominantly inner-halo population, with a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.0 and a mean Galactic rotation of -4 $\pm$ 31 km s-1. We infer the density of halo and thick disk BHB stars is 104 $\pm$ 37 kpc-3 near the Sun, and the relative normalization of halo to thick-disk BHB stars is 4 $\pm$ 1% near the Sun.},

Approximately 55% of these stars belong to the clump of stars detected earlier by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. According to our measurements, this feature has ~10 times the background density of halo stars, spans at least 37.5d by 3.5d in α and δ (>=30 by >=3 kpc), lies ~50 kpc from the Sun, and has a depth along the line of sight of ~5 kpc (1 σ). These properties are consistent with the recent models that suggest that it is a tidal stream from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The mean period of the type ab variables, 0.58 days, is also consistent. In addition, we have found two smaller overdensities in the halo, one of which may be related to the globular cluster Pal 5.},

title = {The Ghost of Sagittarius and Lumps in the Halo of the Milky Way},
abstract = {We identify new structures in the halo of the Milky Way from positions, colors, and magnitudes of five million stars detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Most of these stars are within 1.26d of the celestial equator. We present color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for stars in two previously discovered, tidally disrupted structures. The CMDs and turnoff colors are consistent with those of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, as had been predicted. In one direction, we are even able to detect a clump of red stars, similar to that of the Sagittarius dwarf, from stars spread across 110 deg2 of sky. Focusing on stars with the colors of F turnoff objects, we identify at least five additional overdensities of stars. Four of these may be pieces of the same halo structure, which would cover a region of the sky at least 40$\,^{\circ}$ in diameter, at a distance of 11 kpc from the Sun (18 kpc from the center of the Galaxy). The turnoff is significantly bluer than that of thick-disk stars, yet the stars lie closer to the Galactic plane than a power-law spheroid predicts. We suggest two models to explain this new structure. One possibility is that this new structure could be a new dwarf satellite of the Milky Way, hidden in the Galactic plane and in the process of being tidally disrupted. The other possibility is that it could be part of a disklike distribution of stars which is metal-poor, with a scale height of approximately 2 kpc and a scale length of approximately 10 kpc. The fifth overdensity, which is 20 kpc away, is some distance from the Sagittarius dwarf streamer orbit and is not associated with any known Galactic structure. We have tentatively identified a sixth overdensity in the halo. If this sixth structure is instead part of a smooth distribution of halo stars (the spheroid), then the spheroid must be very flattened, with axial ratio q=0.5. It is likely that there are many smaller streams of stars in the Galactic halo.},

title = {Structure and Kinematics of the Stellar Halos and Thick Disks of the Milky Way Based on Calibration Stars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7},
abstract = {The structure and kinematics of the recognized stellar components of the Milky Way are explored, based on well-determined atmospheric parameters and kinematic quantities for 32360 "calibration stars" from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and its first extension, SDSS-II, which included the sub-survey Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE). Full space motions for a sub-sample of 16,920 stars, exploring a local volume within 4 kpc of the Sun, are used to derive velocity ellipsoids for the inner- and outer-halo components of the Galaxy, as well as for the canonical thick-disk and proposed metal-weak thick-disk (MWTD) populations. This new sample of calibration stars represents an increase of 60% relative to the numbers used in a previous analysis. We first examine the question of whether the data require the presence of at least a two-component halo in order to account for the rotational behavior of likely halo stars in the local volume, and whether more than two components are needed. We also address the question of whether the proposed MWTD is kinematically and chemically distinct from the canonical thick disk, and point out that the Galactocentric rotational velocity inferred for the MWTD, as well as its mean metallicity, appear quite similar to the values derived previously for the Monoceros stream, suggesting a possible association between these structures. In addition, we consider the fractions of each component required to understand the nature of the observed kinematic behavior of the stellar populations of the Galaxy as a function of distance from the plane. Scale lengths and scale heights for the thick-disk and MWTD components are determined. Spatial density profiles for the inner- and outer-halo populations are inferred from a Jeans theorem analysis. The full set of calibration stars (including those outside the local volume) is used to test for the expected changes in the observed stellar metallicity distribution function with distance above the Galactic plane in situ, due to the changing contributions from the underlying stellar populations. The above issues are considered, in concert with theoretical and observational constraints from other Milky-Way-like galaxies, in light of modern cold dark matter galaxy formation models.},

abstract = {We present star count data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for 5.8×105 stars brighter than g'=21 mag over 279 deg2 in two samples north and south of the Galactic plane. Using these high-latitude (49$\,^{\circ}$<|b|<64$\,^{\circ}$) star counts we determine the Sun's distance from the Galactic midplane to be 27+/-4 pc and the scale height of the old thin disk to be 330+/-3 pc. Because of the photometric accuracy and large area sky coverage of these data, the color-magnitude diagram clearly reveals a significant thick-disk population distinct in color from a Galactic halo population. The position of the thick-disk turnoff is at g'-r'~0.33. Several questions about the existence of the thick disk and its origin are addressed through a set of model fits to the star count data. Our best-fit model gives a thick-disk scale height between 580 and 750 pc, below the original proposal of Gilmore and Reid, and the corresponding space number density normalization is 13%-6.5% of the thin disk. The conclusions reached in this paper favor a scenario in which the thick disk formed through the heating of a preexisting thin disk, with the heating mechanism being the merging of a satellite galaxy. The density law for the Galactic halo population is also investigated. We find that the data support a flattened halo with c/a~0.55+/-0.06 and a relatively flat power-law index (2.5+/-0.3). The axis ratio of the visible halo found in this paper is compatible with that of dark halo, suggesting that they have the same shape and dynamical origin.

Key empirical facts about stellar systems are briefly reviewed, and the ingredients needed to construct galaxy models are assembled, including potential theory, stellar orbits, and the theory of the equilibrium configurations of stellar systems. The stability of these configurations and the theory of spiral structures are discussed. Collisions and encounters between stellar systems are considered, and two-body realization and the approach to statistical equilibrium in star clusters are addressed. It is shown how the observable properties of galaxies such as their luminosities and colors are changed by the aging of their constituent stellar populations.

title = {A New Analysis of RR Lyrae Kinematics in the Solar Neighborhood},
abstract = {Full space velocities are computed for a sample of 130 nearby RR Lyrae variables using both ground-based and Hipparcos proper motions. In many cases proper motions for the same star from multiple sources have been averaged to produce approximately a factor of 2 improvement in the transverse space velocity errors. In most cases, this exceeds the accuracy attained using Hipparcos proper motions alone. The velocity ellipsoids computed for halo and thick-disk samples are in agreement with those reported in previous studies. A distinct sample of thin-disk RR Lyrae variables has not been isolated, but there is kinematic evidence for some thin-disk contamination in our thick-disk samples. Using kinematic and spatial parameters, a sample of 21 stars with [Fe/H] < -1.0 and disklike kinematics have been isolated. From their kinematics and spatial distribution we conclude that these stars represent a sample of RR Lyrae variables in the metal-weak tail of the thick disk that extends to [Fe/H] = -2.05. In the halo samples, the distribution of V velocities is not Gaussian, even when the metal-weak thick-disk stars are removed. Possibly related, a plot of U and W velocities as a function of V velocity for the kinematically unbiased halo sample shows some curious structure. The cause of these kinematic anomalies is not clear. In addition, systematic changes to the distance scale within the range of currently accepted values of M_v(RR) are shown to significantly change the calculated halo kinematics. Fainter values of M_v(RR), such as those obtained by statistical parallax (~0.60 to 0.70 at [Fe/H] = -1.9), result in local halo kinematics similar to those reported in independent studies of halo kinematics, while brighter values of M_v(RR), such as those obtained through recent analysis of Hipparcos subdwarf parallaxes (~0.30 to 0.40 at [Fe/H] = -1.9), result in a halo with retrograde rotation and significantly enlarged velocity dispersions.},

title = {Old stellar Galactic disc in near-plane regions according to 2MASS: Scales, cut-off, flare and warp},
abstract = {We have pursued two different methods to analyze the old stellar population near the Galactic plane, using data from the 2MASS survey. The first method is based on the isolation of the red clump giant population in the color-magnitude diagrams and the inversion of its star counts to obtain directly the density distribution along the line of sight. The second method fits the parameters of a disc model to the star counts in 820 regions. Results from both independent methods are consistent with each other. The qualitative conclusions are that the disc is well fitted by an exponential distribution in both the galactocentric distance and height. There is not an abrupt cut-off in the stellar disc (at least within R<15 kpc). There is a strong flare (i.e. an increase of scale-height towards the outer Galaxy) which begins well inside the solar circle, and hence there is a decrease of the scale-height towards the inner Galaxy. Another notable feature is the existence of a warp in the old stellar population whose amplitude is coincident with the amplitude of the gas warp. It is shown for low latitude stars (mean height: |z| ~ 300 pc) in the outer disc (galactocentric radius R> 6 kpc) that: the scale-height in the solar circle is hz(Rsun)=3.6x 10-2 Rsun, the scale-length of the surface density is hR=0.42 Rsun and the scale-length of the space density in the plane (i.e. including the effect of the flare) is H=0.25 Rsun. The variation of the scale-height due to the flare follows roughly a law hz(R)~ hz(Rsun) exp (R-Rsun)/([12-0.6R(kpc)] kpc) (for R<~ 15 kpc; Rsun=7.9 kpc). The warp moves the mean position of the disc to a height zw=1.2x 10-3 R(kpc)5.25sin (phi +5o ) pc (for R<~ 13 kpc; Rsun=7.9 kpc).},

title = {Detection of a galactic color gradient for blue horizontal-branch stars of the halo field and implications for the halo age and density distributions},
abstract = {From analysis of a large sample of field blue horizontal-branch stars we find that the mean unreddened color, <B-V>w, in the color window -0.02 <(B-V)0 < +0.18 increases outward in the Galaxy by ˜0.025 on 2 kpc < R < 12 kpc. On the basis of several tests of the sample, we conclude that this result is due neither to errors in reddening estimates nor to contamination of the sample by stars of the young disk or by the population described by Lance (1988b). Calibration of the horizontal-branch (HB) parameter B/(B + R) with two theoretical, age-dependent isochrone parameters and an empirical correlation between <B-V>w and B/(B + R) suggest that the mean age of the field horizontal branch decreases outward in the halo systematically by a few Gyr. HB models appropriate for standard red giant evolution lead to a similar conclusion, but HB theory also permits an interpretation of the color gradient as a consequence of a systematic outward decrease in HB core mass at constant age, for which there is no plausible reason. We calculate space densities of blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars from our sample and recalculate space densities for RR Lyrae stars from published data. The RR Lyrae densities are well represented by a spheroidal power-law model in which flattening decreases outward. The power-law exponent for the RR Lyrae stars is n = -3.2$\pm$0.1. BHB stars in a more restricted distance range yield n = -3.5, as would be expected from the sign of the color gradient. Predicted densities of BHB and RR Lyrae stars in the solar neighborhood, their ratio (6.5/1), and the abundance distribution and horizontal-branch morphologies of globular clusters are used to estimate the local density of red HB stars and the total local HB number density, 42 kpc-3. Total HB populations for 44 globular clusters, derived from published photometry and the use of King models, establish that the visual luminosity of a globular cluster is closely proportional to the number of HB stars that it contains. The ratio is Lv/NHB = 540$\pm$40 uncorrected for incompleteness of the counts that would decrease it, or possible radial stratification of HB stars in clusters that would increase it. From the local field HB number density, Lv/NHB, and an assumed M/Lv = 2.5, we estimate the local halo mass density to be 5.7 × 104 Msun kpc-3, a value within the range estimated by other methods. The local observed density of metal-poor RR Lyrae stars unaccountably exceeds the number predicted by our model by a factor of at least 2.},

title = {Candidate RR Lyrae Stars Found in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Commissioning Data},
abstract = {We present a sample of 148 candidate RR Lyrae stars selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning data for about 100 deg2 of sky surveyed twice with Δt=1.9946 days. Although the faint-magnitude limit of the SDSS allows us to detect RR Lyrae stars to large Galactocentric distances (~100 kpc, or r*~21), we find no candidates fainter than r*~20, i.e., farther than ~65 kpc from the Galactic center. On the assumption that all 148 candidates are indeed RR Lyrae stars (contamination by other species of variable star is probably less than 10%), we find that their volume density has roughly a power-law dependence on Galactocentric radius, R-2.7+/-0.2, between 10 and 50 kpc and drops abruptly at R~50-60 kpc, possibly indicating a sharp edge to the stellar halo as traced by RR Lyrae stars. The Galactic distribution of stars in this sample is very inhomogeneous and shows a clump of over 70 stars at about 45 kpc from the Galactic center. This clump is also detected in the distribution of nonvariable objects with RR Lyrae star colors. When sources in the clump are excluded, the best power-law fit becomes consistent with the R-3 distribution found from surveys of bright RR Lyrae stars. These results imply that the halo contains clumpy overdensities inhomogeneously distributed within a smooth R-3 background, with a possible cutoff at ~50 kpc. Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

title = {Three-dimensional Structure of the Milky Way Disk: The Distribution of Stars and Dust beyond 0.35 Rsolar},
abstract = {We present a three-dimensional model for the Milky Way fitted to the far-infrared (FIR) and near-infrared (NIR) data from the COBE/DIRBE instrument for Galactic latitudes |b|<30deg and to within 20$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic center. Because of the low optical depth at 240 μm, the FIR emission traces the distribution of Galactic dust in the Galaxy. We model the dust distribution as due to three components: a warped exponential disk with scale length 0.28 Rsolar and a flaring scale height, a spiral arm component with four arms as traced by Galactic H II regions, and the local (Orion) arm, which produces prominent emission features at Galactic longitudes l~=80 and -100$\,^{\circ}$. A cosmic infrared background of 1.07 MJy sr-1 is recovered, consistent with previous determinations. The dust distribution is then used to calculate absorption in J and K, and the stellar emission in these wavebands is modeled with two components: a warped exponential disk with a scale length of 0.28 Rsolar and a spiral arm component dominated by two arms. This small scale length is consistent with a maximal disk model for our Galaxy, which is inconsistent with the cuspy dark matter halos predicted in CDM models. We find different amplitudes for the warp in the stars and dust, which starts within the solar circle.},

The disk has an outer edge four kpc from the Sun, and is warped like the HI layer. It has a central hole roughly the diameter of the inner edge of the "three-kiloparsec" molecular cloud ring, and within that hole lies a bright, strong, "early-type" bar, tilted approximately 14 degrees from the Sun-Galactic center line. The model has 47 free parameters. The model is discussed in detail and contour plots and images of the residuals presented.},

The 2.2-micron/12-micron flux ratio for the bulge is typical of other dust-free spheroidal systems.

abstract = {The Bulge is the least understood major stellar population of the Milky Way. Most of what we know about the formation and evolution of the Bulge comes from bright giant stars. The underlying assumption that giants represent all the stars, and accurately trace the chemical evolution of a stellar population, is under debate. In particular, recent observations of a few microlensed dwarf stars give a very different picture of the evolution of the Bulge from that given by the giant stars. [ABRIDGED] We perform a detailed elemental abundance analysis of dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge, based on high-resolution spectra that were obtained while the stars were optically magnified during gravitational microlensing events. [ABRIDGED] We present detailed elemental abundances and stellar ages for six new dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge. Combining these with previous events, here re-analysed with the same methods, we study a homogeneous sample of 15 stars, which constitute the largest sample to date of microlensed dwarf stars in the Galactic bulge. We find that the stars span the full range of metallicities from [Fe/H]=-0.72 to +0.54, and an average metallicity of <[Fe/H]>=-0.08+/-0.47, close to the average metallicity based on giant stars in the Bulge. Furthermore, the stars follow well-defined abundance trends, that for [Fe/H]<0 are very similar to those of the local Galactic thick disc. This suggests that the Bulge and the thick disc have had, at least partially, comparable chemical histories. At sub-solar metallicities we find the Bulge dwarf stars to have consistently old ages, while at super-solar metallicities we find a wide range of ages. Using the new age and abundance results from the microlensed dwarf stars we investigate possible formation scenarios for the Bulge.},

title = {Thick disks of lenticular galaxies. 3D-photometric thin/thick disk decomposition of eight edge-on s0 galaxies},
abstract = {Thick disks are faint and extended stellar components found around several disk galaxies including our Milky Way. The Milky Way thick disk, the only one studied in detail, contains mostly old disk stars (≈10 Gyr), so that thick disks are likely to trace the early stages of disk evolution. Previous detections of thick disk stellar light in external galaxies have been originally made for early-type, edge-on galaxies but detailed 2D thick/thin disk decompositions have been reported for only a scant handful of mostly late-type disk galaxies. We present in this paper for the first time explicit 3D thick/thin disk decompositions characterising the presence and properties (e.g. scalelength and scaleheight) for a sample of eight lenticular galaxies by fitting 3D disk models to the data. For six out of the eight galaxies we were able to derive a consistent thin/thick disk model. The mean scaleheight of the thick disk is 3.6 times larger than that of the thin disk. The scalelength of the thick disk is about twice, and its central luminosity density between 3-10% of, the thin disk value. Both thin and thick disk are truncated at similar radii. This implies that thick disks extend over fewer scalelengths than thin disks, and turning a thin disk into a thick one requires therefore vertical but little radial heating. All these structural parameters are similar to thick disk parameters for later Hubble-type galaxies previously studied. We discuss our data in respect to present models for the origin of thick disks, either as pre- or post-thin-disk structures, providing new observational constraints.

title = {Misaligned Angular Momentum in Hydrodynamic Cosmological Simulations: Warps, Outer Discs, and Thick Discs},
abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of a disc galaxy forming in a high-resolution fully cosmological simulation to investigate the nature of the outer regions of discs and their relevance for the disc formation process. Specifically, we focus on the phenomenon of misaligned disc components and find that the outer disc warp is a consequence of the misalignment between the inner disc and the surrounding hot gaseous halo. As the infalling cold gas sinks toward the centre of the galaxy, it is strongly torqued by the hot gas halo. By the time the fresh gas reaches the central disc-forming region its angular momentum is completely aligned with the spin of the hot gas halo. If the spin of the hot gas halo, in turn, is not aligned with that of the inner disc, a misaligned outer disc forms comprised of newly accreted material. The inner and outer components are misaligned with each other because they respond differently to infalling substructure and accretion. The warped disc feeds the main gas disc due to viscous angular momentum losses, but small amounts of star formation in the warp itself form a low-metallicity thick disc. We show that observations of resolved stellar populations in warped galaxies in the local universe could provide evidence for the presence of these processes and therefore indirectly reveal ongoing gas accretion and the existence of hot gas halos.},

abstract = {We employ N-body, smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations, including detailed treatment of chemical enrichment, to follow a gas-rich merger that results in a galaxy with disk morphology. We trace the kinematic, structural, and chemical properties of stars formed before, during, and after the merger. We show that such a merger produces two exponential disk components, with the older, hotter component having a scale length 20% larger than the later forming, cold disk. Rapid star formation during the merger quickly enriches the protogalactic gas reservoir, resulting in high metallicities of the forming stars. These stars form from gas largely polluted by Type II supernovae, which form rapidly in the merger-induced starburst. After the merger, a thin disk forms from gas that has had time to be polluted by Type Ia supernovae. Abundance trends are plotted, and we examine the proposal that increased star formation during gas-rich mergers may explain the high α-to-iron abundance ratios that exist in the relatively high-metallicity, thick-disk component of the Milky Way.},

(2009). We find that the distribution of our sample is peaked at low eccentricities and falls off smoothly and rather steeply to high eccentricities. This distribution is fairly robust to changes in distances, thin disc contamination, and the particular thick disc sample used. Our results are inconsistent with what is expected for the pure accretion simulation, since we find that the dynamics of local thick disc stars implies that the majority must have formed "in situ". Of the remaining models explored, the eccentricity distribution of our stars appears to be most consistent with the gas-rich merger case.},

title = {Elemental abundance survey of the Galactic thick disc},
abstract = {We have performed an abundance analysis for F- and G- dwarfs of the Galactic thick-disc component. A sample of 176 nearby (d<= 150pc) thick-disc candidate stars was chosen from the Hipparcos catalogue and subjected to a high-resolution spectroscopic analysis. Using accurate radial velocities combined with the Hipparcos astrometry, kinematics (U, V and W) and Galactic orbital parameters were computed. We estimate the probability for a star to belong to the thin disc, the thick disc or the halo. With a probability P>= 70 per cent taken as certain membership, we assigned 95 stars to the thick disc, 13 to the thin disc, and 20 to the halo. The remaining 48 stars in the sample cannot be assigned with reasonable certainty to one of the three components. Abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ba, Ce, Nd and Eu have been obtained. The abundances for the thick-disc stars are compared with those for the thin-disc members from Reddy et al. The ratios of α-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti) to iron for thick-disc stars show a clear enhancement compared to thin-disc members in the range -0.3 < [Fe/H] < -1.2. There are also other elements - Al, Sc, V, Co, and possibly Zn - which show enhanced ratios to iron in the thick disc relative to the thin disc. The abundances of Na, Cr, Mn, Ni and Cu (relative to Fe) are very similar for thin- and thick-disc stars. The dispersion in abundance ratios [X/Fe] at given [Fe/H] for thick-disc stars is consistent with the expected scatter due to measurement errors, suggesting a lack of `cosmic' scatter. A few stars classified as members of the thick disc by our kinematic criteria show thin-disc abundances. These stars, which appear older than most thin-disc stars, are also, on average, younger than the thick-disc population. They may have originated early in the thin-disc history, and been subsequently scattered to hotter orbits by collisions. The thick disc may not include stars with [Fe/H] > -0.3. The observed compositions of the thin and thick discs seem to be consistent with the models of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering in a Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) universe.},

The resulting relation shows that the Milky Way stellar disk was relatively quiescent, suffering little heating or dispersion increase between 3 and 9 Gyr. However, at an age of 9 Gyr there is an abrupt increase in the stellar velocity dispersions. To explain the abrupt increase (by almost a factor of 2) in dispersions we propose that the Milky Way suffered a minor merger 9 Gyr ago that created the thick disk. The quiescent phase is consistent with inefficient heating caused by scattering from tightly wound transient spiral structure.},

title = {Galactic structure studies from the Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut survey},
abstract = {We present an analysis of the photometric parallaxes of stars in 21 of the Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut Survey fields carried out with the National Astronomical Observatories (NAOC) 60/90 cm Schmidt Telescope in 15 intermediate-band filters from 3000 to 10000 {\AA}. In this study, we have adopted a three-component (thin disc, thick disc and halo) model to analyse star count information. By calculating the stellar space density as a function of distance from the Galactic plane, we determine that the range of scaleheight for the thin disc varies from 220 to 320 pc. Although 220 pc seems an extreme value, it is close to the lower limit in the literature. The range of scaleheight for the thick disc is from 600 to 1100 pc, and the corresponding space number density normalization is 7.0-1.0 per cent of the thin disc. We find that the scaleheight of the disc may be variable with the observed direction, which cannot simply be attributed to statistical errors. Possibly the main reasons can be attributed to the disc (mainly the thick disc) being flared, with a scaleheight increasing with radius. The structure is consistent with the merger origin for the thick disc formation. Adopting a de Vaucouleurs r1/4 law halo, we also find that the axis ratio towards the Galactic Centre is somewhat flatter (~0.4), while the shape of the halo in the anticentre and antirotation direction is rounder with c/a > 0.4. Our results show that star counts in different lines of sight can be used directly to obtain a rough estimate of the shape of the stellar halo. Our solutions support the Galactic models with a flattened inner halo, possibly formed by an early merger in the Galaxy's history.},

title = {Riding the Spiral Waves: Implications of Stellar Migration for the Properties of Galactic Disks},
abstract = {Stars in disks of spiral galaxies are usually assumed to remain roughly at their birth radii. This assumption is built into decades of modeling of the evolution of stellar populations in our own Galaxy and in external systems. We present results from self-consistent high-resolution N-body + smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations of disk formation, in which stars migrate across significant galactocentric distances due to resonant scattering with transient spiral arms, while preserving their circular orbits. We investigate the implications of such migrations for observed stellar populations. Radial migration provides an explanation for the observed flatness and spread in the age-metallicity relation and the relative lack of metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood. The presence of radial migration also prompts rethinking of interpretations of extragalactic stellar population data, especially for determinations of star formation histories.},

title = {Properties of tidally-triggered vertical disk perturbations},
abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the properties of warps and tidally-triggered perturbations perpendicular to the plane of 47 interacting/merging edge-on spiral galaxies. The derived parameters are compared with those obtained for a sample of 61 non-interacting edge-on spirals. The entire optical (R-band) sample used for this study was presented in two previous papers. We find that the scale height of disks in the interacting/merging sample is characterized by perturbations on both large ( =~ disk cut-off radius) and short ( =~ z0) scales, with amplitudes of the order of 280 pc and 130 pc on average, respectively. The size of these large (short) -scale instabilities corresponds to 14% (6%) of the mean disk scale height. This is a factor of 2 (1.5) larger than the value found for non-interacting galaxies. A hallmark of nearly all tidally distorted disks is a scale height that increases systematically with radial distance. The frequent occurrence and the significantly larger size of these gradients indicate that disk asymmetries on large scales are a common and persistent phenomenon, while local disturbances and bending instabilities decline on shorter timescales. Nearly all (93%) of the interacting/merging and 45% of the non-interacting galaxies studied are noticeably warped. Warps of interacting/merging galaxies are ~ 2.5 times larger on average than those observed in the non-interacting sample, with sizes of the order of 340 pc and 140 pc, respectively. This indicates that tidal distortions do considerably contribute to the formation and size of warps. However, they cannot entirely explain the frequent occurrence of warped disks.

These stars are faint, 15 less than or approximately = V less than or approximately = 18, selected on the basis of color, being a subset of the larger survey of Gilmore and Wyse designed to determine the properties of the stellar populations several kiloparsecs from the Sun. The fields studied in the present paper probe the iron abundance distribution of the stellar populations of the galaxy at 500-3000 pc above the plane, at the solar Galactocentric distance. The derived chemical abundance distributions are consistent with no metallicity gradients in the thick disk over this range of vertical distance, and with an iron abundance distribution for the thick disk that has a peak at -0.7 dex. The lack of a vertical gradient argues against slow, dissipational settling as a mechanism for the formation of the thick disk. The photometric and metallicity data support a turn-off of the thick disk that is comparable in age to the metal-rich globular clusters, or greater than or approximately = 12 Gyr, and are consistent with a spread to older ages.},

abstract = {Using effective temperature and metallicity derived from SDSS spectra for ~60,000 F- and G-type main-sequence stars (0.2<g-r<0.6), we develop polynomial models for estimating these parameters from the SDSS u-g and g-r colors. These photometric estimates have similar error properties as those determined from SDSS spectra. We apply this method to SDSS photometric data for over 2 million F/G stars and measure the unbiased metallicity distribution for a complete volume-limited sample of stars at distances between 500 pc and 8 kpc. The metallicity distribution can be exquisitely modeled using two components with a spatially varying number ratio, which correspond to disk and halo. The two components also possess the kinematics expected for disk and halo stars. The metallicity of the halo component is spatially invariant, while the median disk metallicity smoothly decreases with distance from the Galactic plane from -0.6 at 500 pc to -0.8 beyond several kiloparsecs. The absence of a correlation between metallicity and kinematics for disk stars is in a conflict with the traditional decomposition in terms of thin and thick disks. We detect coherent substructures in the kinematics-metallicity space, such as the Monoceros stream, which rotates faster than the LSR, and has a median metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.95, with an rms scatter of only ~0.15 dex. We extrapolate our results to the performance expected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and estimate that LSST will obtain metallicity measurements accurate to 0.2 dex or better, with proper-motion measurements accurate to ~0.5 mas yr-1, for about 200 million F/G dwarf stars within a distance limit of ~100 kpc (g<23.5).},

We review here our previous studies which have shown the importance of mergers at high redshift being gas rich, in the formation of both the stellar halo and thick disk components of disk galaxies. Regulation of star formation in the building blocks of our galaxy is required to form a low mass low metallicity stellar halo. This regulation results in high redshift, gas rich mergers during which the thick disk forms. In these proceedings, we categorise stars from our simulated disk galaxy into thin and thick disk components by using the Toomre diagram. Rotation velocity, metallicity and age histograms of the two populations are presented, along with alpha element abundances (oxygen, silicone, magnesium), age-height above the plane, age-radius, metallicity-height, and metalicity-radius gradients.},

title = {Chemistry and Kinematics in the Solar Neighborhood: Implications for Stellar Populations and for Galaxy Evolution},
abstract = {The immediate Solar neighborhood should be a fair sample of the local Galaxy. However, the chemical abundance distribution of long-lived disk stars very near the Sun contains a factor of 5 to 10 more metal-poor stars, -1≲[Fe/H]≲-0.4 dex, than is consistent with modem star-count models of larger scale Galactic structure. The metallicity distribution of complete samples of long-lived stars has long been recognized as providing unique constraints on the early stages of chemical evolution of the Galaxy, so that one would like to resolve this anomaly. We present a new derivation of the local G-dwarf metallicity distribution, based on the Third Gliese catalog combined with Olsen's (A{\&}AS, 54, 55, 1983) Str{\"o}mgren photometry. Kinematic data for these same stars, as well as for a high-precision sample studied by Edvardsson et al. (A{\&}A, 275, 101, 1993), provide clear evidence that the abundance distribution below [Fe/H]˜ -0.4 contains two over-lapping distributions, the thick disk and the thin disk. However these samples in isolation do not allow a reliable deconvolution of the relative numbers in each population. We achieve this by comparing the local metallicity distribution with a recent (Gilmore, Wyse, {\&} Jones, AJ, 109, 1095, 1995) of the metallicity distribution of stars, selected with the same evolutionary criteria as applied to our nearby star sample, but found in situ some 1500 pc from the Sun. The gravitational sieve of the Galactic potential acts on this second sample to segregate the low velocity dispersion, thin-disk, component of the local sample, leaving predominantly the second, higher velocity dispersion component. Thus the two samples are complementary, with the local sample providing accurate data primarily for the thin disk, but weak thin-disk/thick-disk discrimination, and the distant sample providing excellent thick-disk/thin-disk segregation. We are thus able to break the degeneracy between overlapping phase-space distributions. That is, the combination of these two datasets allows us to determine the source of the local paradox: there is a substantial tail of the thin disk (defined kinematically) metallicity distribution, which extends below [Fe/H]≍ -0.4 dex. This is a robust conclusion, being consistent with the sum of star count, stellar spatial density distribution, and both local and distant kinematic and chemical abundance data. Using the sum of this information, we deconvolve the local abundance distribution function into thin disk and thick disk components, and show these overlap considerably. This overlap has implications for some dynamical merger models of the formation of the thick disk. The observed scatter in the thin disk age- metallicity relation however obscures any simple interpretation in terms of thick disk formation models. The chemical abundance distributions derived in this paper, which are based on the sum of local and distant data, and so are directly integrated over the Solar Cylinder, improve long-standing constraints on Galactic disk evolution. When combined with age and element ratio data, comprehensive constraints on the evolution of the disk will be available.},

title = {The metal content of bulge field stars from FLAMES-GIRAFFE spectra. I. Stellar parameters and iron abundances},
abstract = {Aims: We determine the iron distribution function (IDF) for bulge field stars, in three different fields along the Galactic minor axis and at latitudes b = -4$\,^{\circ}$, b = -6$\,^{\circ}$, and b = -12$\,^{\circ}$. A fourth field including NGC 6553 is also included in the discussion. Methods: About 800 bulge field K giants were observed with the GIRAFFE spectrograph of FLAMES@VLT at spectral resolution R ~ 20 000. Several of them were observed again with UVES at R ~ 45 000 to insure the accuracy of the measurements. The LTE abundance analysis yielded stellar parameters and iron abundances that allowed us to construct an IDF for the bulge that, for the first time, is based on high-resolution spectroscopy for each individual star. Results: The IDF derived here is centered on solar metallicity, and extends from [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 to [Fe/H] ~ +0.5. The distribution is asymmetric, with a sharper cutoff on the high-metallicity side, and it is narrower than previously measured. A variation in the mean metallicity along the bulge minor axis is clearly between b = -4$\,^{\circ}$ and b = -6$\,^{\circ}$ ([Fe/H] decreasing ~ by 0.6 dex per kpc). The field at b = -12$\,^{\circ}$ is consistent with the presence of a gradient, but its quantification is complicated by the higher disk/bulge fraction in this field. Conclusions: Our findings support a scenario in which both infall and outflow were important during the bulge formation, and then suggest the presence of a radial gradient, which poses some challenges to the scenario in which the bulge would result solely from the vertical heating of the bar.

title = {A survey of proper motion stars. 12: an expanded sample},
abstract = {We report new photometry and radial velocities for almost 500 stars from the Lowell Proper Motion Catalog. We combine these results with our prior sample and rederive stellar temperatures based on the photometry, reddening, metallicities (using chi squared matching of our 22,500 low Signal to Noise (S/N) high resolution echelle spectra with a grid of synthetic spectra), distances, space motions, and Galactic orbital parameters for 1269 (kinematics) and 1261 (metallicity) of the 1464 stars in the complete survey. The frequency of spectroscopic binaries for the metal-poor ((m/H) less than or equal to -1.2) stars with periods shorter than 3000 days is at least 15%. The spectroscopic binary frequency for metal-rich stars ((m/H) greater than -0.5) appears to be lower, about 9%, but this may be a selection effect. We also discuss special classes of stars, including treatment of the double-lined spectroscopic binaries, and identification of subgiants. Four possible new members of the class of field blue stragglers are noted. We point out the detection of three possible new white dwarfs, six broad-lined (binary) systems, and discuss briefly the three already known nitrogen-rich halo dwarfs. The primary result of this paper will be available on CD-ROM, in the form of a much larger table.},

title = {VLT/UVES Abundances in Four Nearby Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies. I. Nucleosynthesis and Abundance Ratios},
abstract = {We have used the Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) on Kueyen (UT2) of the Very Large Telescope to take spectra of 15 individual red giants in the Sculptor, Fornax, Carina, and Leo I dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph's). We measure the abundances of α-, iron peak, first s-process, second s-process, and r-process elements. No dSph giants in our sample show the deep mixing abundance pattern (O and sometimes Mg depleted, while Na and Al are enhanced) seen in nearly all globular clusters. At a given metallicity the dSph giants exhibit lower [el/Fe] abundance ratios for the α-elements than stars in the Galactic halo. The low α abundances at low metallicities can be caused by a slow star formation rate and contribution from Type Ia SNe, and/or a small star formation event (low total mass) and mass-dependent Type II SN yields. In addition, Leo I and Sculptor exhibit a declining even-Z [el/Fe] pattern with increasing metallicity, while Fornax exhibits no significant slope. In contrast, Carina shows a large spread in the even-Z abundance pattern, even over small metallicity ranges, as might be expected from a bursting star formation history. The metal-poor stars in these dSph galaxies ([Fe/H]<-1) have halo-like s- and r-process abundances, but not every dSph exhibits the same evolution in the s- and r-process abundance pattern. Carina, Sculptor, and Fornax show a rise in the s-/r-process ratio with increasing metallicity, evolving from a pure r-process ratio to a solar-like s- and r-process ratio. On the other hand, Leo I, appears to show an r-process-dominated ratio over the range in metallicities sampled. At present, we attribute these differences in the star formation histories of these galaxies. Comparison of the dSph abundances with those of the halo reveals some consistencies with the Galactic halo. In particular, Nissen {\&} Shuster found that their metal-rich, high Rmax high zmax halo stars exhibited low [α/Fe], [Na/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] abundance ratios. In the same abundance range our dSph exhibit the same abundance pattern, supporting their suggestions that disrupted dSph's may explain up to 50% of the metal-rich halo. Unfortunately, similar comparisons with the metal-poor Galactic halo have not revealed similar consistencies, suggesting that the majority of the metal-poor Galactic halo could not have been formed from objects similar to the dSph studied here. We use the dSph abundances to place new constraints on the nucleosynthetic origins of several elements. We attribute differences in the evolution of [Y/Fe] in the dSph stars versus the halo stars to a very weak AGB or SN Ia yield of Y (especially compared with Ba). That a lower and flatter Ba/Y ratio is seen in the halo is most likely a result of the pattern being erased by the large metallicity dispersion in the halo. Also, we find [Cu/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] are flat and halo-like over the metallicity city range -2<[Fe/H]<-1.2, and that the [Cu/α] ratios are flat. Combining these abundances with knowledge of the age spread in these galaxies suggests that SNe Ia are not the main site for the production of Cu (and Mn) in very metal-poor stars. We suggest that metallicity-dependent SN yields may be more promising.

title = {Abundance Patterns in the Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies},
abstract = {The Keck I telescope and the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) have been used to obtain spectra for red giant stars belonging to the Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. An analysis of these spectra is presented, along with abundance ratios for more than 20 elements. The resulting database of element abundances for 17 dSph stars is the most extensive yet assembled for stars in such environments. Our principal findings are summarized as follows. (1) There is unambiguous evidence for a large internal dispersion in metallicity in all three galaxies: our program stars span a range of Δ[Fe/H]=1.53, 1.40, and 0.73 dex in Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor, respectively. (2) The abundance patterns among the dSph stars are remarkably uniform, suggesting that three galaxies have similar nucleosynthetic histories and, presumably, similar initial mass functions. (3) A comparison of the measured element abundance ratios for our sample of dSph stars with published values for Galactic halo and disk field stars suggests that the dSph galaxies have 0.02<~[α/Fe]<~0.13 dex, whereas the halo field star sample has [α/Fe]~0.28 dex over the same range in metallicity. (4) The most metal-rich dSph stars in our sample have [Y/Fe] abundances that are significantly lower than those measured for halo field stars of similar metallicity, while the measured [Ba/Eu] ratios for the dSph stars suggest that the early chemical evolution of these galaxies was dominated by the r-process. Taken together, these results suggest that the Galactic halo is unlikely to have assembled, in its entirety, through the disruption of dwarf galaxies similar to the low-luminosity, <LV>=3×105LV,solar, dSph galaxies studied here. We also note that the measured [Zn/Fe] abundance ratios for the dSph stars are lower than those of damped Lyα systems having low levels of dust depletion by roughly an order of magnitude. The first high-resolution abundance analysis for the distant Galactic globular cluster NGC 2419 is also presented. From a HIRES spectrum of a single red giant, we find a metallicity of [Fe/H]=-2.32+/-0.11 dex. This is slightly lower than, but still consistent with, published estimates based on low-resolution spectroscopy. With the possible exception of a slight enhancement in the abundances of some heavy elements such as Ce, Nd, Y, and Ba, the observed abundance pattern closely resembles those exhibited by red giants in M92: a nearby, well-studied globular cluster of nearly identical metallicity.},

title = {The chemical compositions of Galactic disc F and G dwarfs},
abstract = {Photospheric abundances are presented for 27 elements from carbon to europium in 181 F and G dwarfs from a differential local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis of high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra. Stellar effective temperatures (Teff) were adopted from an infrared flux method calibration of Str{\"o}mgren photometry. Stellar surface gravities (g) were calculated from Hipparcos parallaxes and stellar evolutionary tracks. Adopted Teff and g values are in good agreement with spectroscopic estimates. Stellar ages were determined from evolutionary tracks. Stellar space motions (U, V, W) and a Galactic potential were used to estimate Galactic orbital parameters. These show that the vast majority of the stars belong to the Galactic thin disc. Relative abundances expressed as [X/Fe] generally confirm previously published results. We give results for C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd and Eu. The α elements - O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti - show [α/Fe] to increase slightly with decreasing [Fe/H]. Heavy elements with dominant contributions at solar metallicity from the s-process show [s/Fe] to decrease slightly with decreasing [Fe/H]. Scatter in [X/Fe] at a fixed [Fe/H] is entirely attributable to the small measurement errors, after excluding the few thick disc stars and the s-process-enriched CH subgiants. Tight limits are set on `cosmic' scatter. If a weak trend with [Fe/H] is taken into account, the composition of a thin disc star expressed as [X/Fe] is independent of the star's age and birthplace for elements contributed in different proportions by massive stars (Type II supernovae), exploding white dwarfs (Type Ia supernovae) and asymptotic red giant branch stars. By combining our sample with various published studies, comparisons between thin and thick disc stars are made. In this composite sample, thick disc stars are primarily identified by their VLSR in the range -40 to -100 km s-1. These are very old stars with origins in the inner Galaxy and metallicities [Fe/H]<=-0.4. At the same [Fe/H], the sampled thin disc stars have VLSR~ 0 km s-1, and are generally younger with a birthplace at about the Sun's Galactocentric distance. In the range -0.35 >=[Fe/H]>=-0.70, well represented by present thin and thick disc samples, [X/Fe] of the thick disc stars is greater than that of thin disc stars for Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti and Eu. [X/Fe] is very similar for the thin and thick disc for - notably - Na and iron-group elements. Barium ([Ba/Fe]) may be underabundant in thick relative to thin disc stars. These results extend previous ideas about composition differences between the thin and thick disc.},

title = {Local stellar kinematics from HIPPARCOS data},
abstract = {From the parallaxes and proper motions of a kinematically unbiased subsample of the Hipparcos Catalogue, we have re-determined as a function of colour the kinematics of main-sequence stars. Whereas the radial and vertical components of the mean heliocentric velocity of stars show no trend with colour, the component in the direction of Galactic rotation nicely follows the asymmetric drift relation, except for stars bluer than B-V=0.1mag. Extrapolating to zero dispersion yields, for the velocity of the Sun with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) in kms^-1, U_0=10.00+/-0.36 (radially inwards), V_0=5.25+/-0.62 (in the direction of Galactic rotation) and W_0=7.17+/-0.38 (vertically upwards). Parenago's discontinuity is beautifully visible in a plot of velocity dispersion against colour: the dispersion, which is essentially constant for late spectral types, decreases towards early spectral types blueward of B-V~0.61mag. We determine the velocity dispersion tensor sigma^2 as function of colour. The mixed moments involving vertical motion are zero within the errors, while sigma^2_xy is non-zero at about (10kms^-1)^2 independently of colour. The resulting vertex deviations are about 20 deg for early-type stars and 10 deg+/-4 deg for old-disc stars. The persistence of the vertex deviation to late-type stars implies that the Galactic potential is significantly non-axisymmetric at the solar radius. If spiral arms are responsible for the non-axisymmetry, they cannot be tightly wound. Except for stars bluer than B-V=0.1mag, the ratios of the principal velocity dispersions are given by sigma_1:sigma_2:sigma_3~2.2:1.4:1, while the absolute values increase with colour from sigma_1~20kms^-1 at B-V=0.2mag to sigma_1~38kms^-1 at Parenago's discontinuity and beyond. These ratios imply significant heating of the disc by spiral structure and that R_0/R_d~=3 to 3.5, where R_d is the scalelength of the disc.},

title = {The radial velocity dispersion profile of the Galactic halo: constraining the density profile of the dark halo of the Milky Way},
abstract = {We have compiled a new sample of 240 halo objects with accurate distance and radial velocity measurements, including globular clusters, satellite galaxies, field blue horizontal branch (FHB) stars and red giant stars from the Spaghetti survey. The new data lead to a significant increase in the number of known objects for Galactocentric radii beyond 50 kpc, which allows a reliable determination of the radial velocity dispersion profile out to very large distances. The radial velocity dispersion shows an almost constant value of 120 km s-1 out to 30 kpc and then continuously declines down to 50 km s-1 at about 120 kpc. This fall-off puts important constraints on the density profile and total mass of the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. For a constant velocity anisotropy, the isothermal profile is ruled out, while both a dark halo following a truncated flat (TF) model of mass 1.2+1.8-0.5× 1012Msolar and a Navarro, Frenk {\&} White (NFW) profile of mass 0.8+1.2-0.2× 1012Msolar and c= 18 are consistent with the data. The significant increase in the number of tracers combined with the large extent of the region probed by these has allowed a more precise determination of the Milky Way mass in comparison to previous works. We also show how different assumptions for the velocity anisotropy affect the performance of the mass models.},

title = {Through Thick and Thin: Kinematic and Chemical Components in the Solar Neighbourhood},
abstract = {We search for the existence of chemically-distinct stellar components in the solar neighbourhood using published data. Extending previous work, we show that when the abundances of Fe, alpha elements, and the r-process element Eu are considered, stars separate neatly into two groups that appear to delineate the traditional thin and thick disk of the Milky Way. The group akin to the thin disk is traced by stars with [Fe/H]>-0.7 and alpha/Fe>0.2. The thick disk-like group overlaps the thin disk in [Fe/H] but, as noted in earlier work, has higher abundances of \alpha elements and Eu. Stars in the range -1.5<[Fe/H]<-0.7 with low [alpha/Fe] ratios, however, seem to belong to a separate, dynamically-cold, non-rotating component that we associate with tidal debris, possibly from the parent galaxy of OmegaCen. The classical kinematically-hot stellar halo dominates the sample for [Fe/H]<-1.5. These results suggest that it may be possible to define the main stellar components of the solar neighbourhood using only their chemistry, an approach with a number of interesting consequences. The kinematics of thin disk stars is then independent of metallicity: their average rotation speed remains roughly constant in the range -0.7<[Fe/H]<+0.4, a result that argues against radial migration having played a substantial role in the evolution of the thin disk. The velocity dispersion of stars assigned to the thin disk is also independent of [Fe/H], implying that the familiar increase in velocity dispersion with decreasing metallicity is the result of the increased prevalence of the thick disk at lower metallicities, rather than of the sustained operation of a dynamical heating mechanism. The substantial overlap in [Fe/H] and, probably, stellar age, of the various components might affect other reported trends in the properties of stars in the solar neighbourhood.},

title = {Lick Indices in the Thin and Thick Disks of Edge-On Disk Galaxies},
abstract = {We have measured Lick index equivalent widths to derive luminosity weighted stellar ages and metallicities for thin- and thick-disk-dominated regions of nine edge-on disk galaxies with the ARC 3.5 m telescope at Apache Point Observatory. In all cases, the thick disks are confirmed to be old stellar populations, with typical ages between 4 and 10 Gyr. The thin disks are uniformly younger than the thick disks, and show strong radial age gradients, with the outer regions of the disks being younger than 1 Gyr. We do not detect any significant metallicity differences or α-element enhancement in the thick-disk stars compared to the thin disk, due to the insensitivity of the Lick indices to these differences at low metallicity. We compare these results to thick disks measured in other systems and to predictions from thick-disk formation models.},

title = {A Structural and Dynamical Study of Late-Type, Edge-on Galaxies. II. Vertical Color Gradients and the Detection of Ubiquitous Thick Disks},
abstract = {We present an analysis of optical (B-R) and optical-infrared (R-Ks) color maps for 47 extremely late-type edge-on unwarped, bulgeless disk galaxies spanning a wide range of mass. The color maps show that the thin disks of these galaxies are embedded in a low surface brightness red envelope. This component is substantially thicker than the thin disk (a:b~4:1 vs. >8:1), extends to at least 5 vertical disk scale heights above the galaxy midplane, and has a radial scale length that appears to be uncorrelated with that of the embedded thin disk. The color of the red envelope is similar from galaxy to galaxy, even when the thin disk is extremely blue, and is consistent with a relatively old (>6 Gyr) stellar population that is not particularly metal-poor. The color difference between the embedded thin disk and the red stellar envelope varies systematically with rotation speed, reflecting an increasing age difference between the thin and thick components in lower mass galaxies, driven primarily by changes in the age of the thin disk. The red stellar envelopes are similar to the thick disk of the Milky Way, having common surface brightnesses, spatial distributions, mean ages, and metallicities. We argue that the ubiquity of the red stellar envelopes implies that the formation of the thick disk is a nearly universal feature of disk formation and is not necessarily connected to the formation of a bulge. Our data suggest that the thick disk forms early (>6 Gyr ago), even within galaxies where the bulk of the stars formed very recently (<2 Gyr). We argue that several aspects of our data and the observed properties of the Milky Way thick disk argue in favor of a merger origin for the thick disk population. If so, then the age of the thick disk marks the end of the epoch of major merging, and the age difference between the younger thin disk and the older thick disk can become a strong constraint on cosmological constants and models of galaxy and/or structure formation.},

title = {A dwarf satellite galaxy in Sagittarius},
abstract = {WE have detected a large, extended group of comoving stars in the direction of the Galactic Centre, which we interpret as belonging to a dwarf galaxy that is closer to our own Galaxy than any other yet known. Located in the constellation of Sagittarius, and on the far side of the Galactic Centre, it has not previously been seen because of the large number of foreground stars (in the Milky Way) in that direction. Following convention, we propose to call it the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Its properties are similar to those of the eight other dwarf spheroidal companions to the Milky Way, and it is comparable in size and luminosity to the largest of them- the Fornax system. The Sagittarius dwarf is elongated towards the plane of the Milky Way, suggesting that it is undergoing some tidal disruption before being absorbed by the Milky Way.},

The stream is approximately 2$\,^{\circ}$ wide and is clearly distinct from the northern tidal arm of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The apparent width of the stream indicates a progenitor with a size and mass similar to that of a dwarf galaxy. The stream is about 21 kpc distant and appears to be oriented almost perpendicular to our line of sight. The visible portion of the stream does not pass near any known dwarf galaxies, although we cannot rule out that the stream may form the inner part of a known dwarf galaxy's orbit. The most likely explanation is that the stream constitutes the remains of a dwarf galaxy that has been completely disrupted at some point in the past. We also briefly report on the discovery of a diminutive Galactic satellite that lies near the projected path of the new stream but is unlikely to be related to it.},

abstract = {Eighteen RR Lyrae variables (RRLs) that lie in the ``12.4h clump'' identified by the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team (QUEST) have been observed spectroscopically to measure their radial velocities and metal abundances. Ten blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) were added to this sample. Six of the nine stars in the densest region of the clump have a mean radial velocity in the Galactic rest frame (Vgsr) of 99.8 and σ=17.3 km s-1, which is slightly smaller than the average error of the measurements. The whole sample contains eight RRLs and five BHB stars that have values of Vgsr suggesting membership in this stream. For seven of these RRLs, the measurements of [Fe/H], which have an internal precision of 0.08 dex, yield <[Fe/H]>=-1.86 and σ=0.40. These values suggest that the stream is a tidally disrupted dwarf spheroidal galaxy of low luminosity. Photometry from the database of the SDSS indicates that this stream covers at least 106 deg2 of the sky in the constellation Virgo. The name Virgo stellar stream is suggested.},

title = {Abundances of Baade's Window Giants from Keck HIRES Spectra. II. The Alpha and Light Odd Elements},
abstract = {We report detailed abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Ti-elements produced by massive stars-for 27 red giants toward the Galactic bulge in Baade's window. These species are overabundant in the bulge relative to the disk, consistent with enhancement by Type II SN ejecta. [Mg/Fe]=+0.3 dex over the full range of [Fe/H], while O, Si, Ca, and Ti are elevated but follow more disklike trends. We propose that the decline in [O/Fe] is due to metallicity-dependent oxygen yields from massive stars, perhaps connected with the Wolf-Rayet phenomenon. The elements Si, Ca, and Ti, believed to be produced during explosive nucleosynthesis, possess identical trends with [Fe/H]. We attribute the decline of these elements to metallicity-dependent yields in Type II SNe. The trend of [Al/Fe] is found to vary strikingly with environment; the range from the Sgr dwarf to the bulge is 0.7 dex. The disjoint composition of the thick/thin disk and bulge stars is inconsistent with models in which the bulge formed from the thickening of the disk, while the elevated alpha elements are consistent with a rapid bulge formation timescale. The starkly smaller scatter of [<SiCaTi>/Fe] with [Fe/H] in the bulge compared with the halo is consistent with the expectation that the bulge should have efficiently mixed. The metal-poor bulge [<SiCaTi>/Fe] ratios are higher than ~80% of the halo; the bulge could not have formed from gas with the present-day halo composition. Based on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.

abstract = {A proper-motion study of a field of 20' × 20' inside Plaut's low-extinction window (l,b) = (0$\,^{\circ}$, - 8$\,^{\circ}$) has been completed. Relative proper motions and photographic BV photometry have been derived for ~21,000 stars reaching to V ~ 20.5 mag, based on the astrometric reduction of 43 photographic plates, spanning over 21 yr of epoch difference. Proper-motion errors are typically 1 mas yr-1, and field-dependent systematics are below 0.2 mas yr-1. Cross-referencing with the 2MASS catalog yielded a sample of ~8700 stars, from which predominantly disk and bulge subsamples were selected photometrically from the JH color-magnitude diagram. The two samples exhibited different proper-motion distributions, with the disk displaying the expected reflex solar motion as a function of magnitude. Galactic rotation was also detected for stars between ~2 and ~3 kpc from us. The bulge sample, represented by red giants, has an intrinsic proper-motion dispersion of (σl,σb) = (3.39 $\pm$ 0.11,2.91 $\pm$ 0.09) mas yr-1, which is in good agreement with previous results and indicates a velocity anisotropy consistent with either rotational broadening or triaxiality. A mean distance of 6.37 kpc has been estimated for the bulge sample, based on the observed K magnitude of the horizontal branch red clump. The metallicity [M/H] distribution was also obtained for a subsample of 60 bulge giants stars, based on calibrated photometric indices. The observed [M/H] shows a peak value at [M/H] ~ -0.1 with an extended metal-poor tail and around 30% of the stars with supersolar metallicity. No change in proper-motion dispersion was observed as a function of [M/H]. We are currently in the process of obtaining CCD UBVRI photometry for the entire proper-motion sample of ~21,000 stars.},

title = {Stellar Abundances of the Galactic Thick Disk},
abstract = {We present the results from model atmosphere analyses of two G dwarfs of the Galactic thick disk, 72 Her and HD 64606. High resolution, high signal-to-noise {\'e}chelle spectra were obtained with the FOCES spectrograph on the 2.2m telescope of the Calar Alto observatory, Spain. Due to the well-defined blaze function of FOCES the determination of the continuum within an order and from order to order in the Hα, Hβ (for Teff) and Mg Ib triplett (for log g) region is very precise and leads to very accurately determined spectroscopic stellar parameters. The aim of our analysis is to study the chemical behaviour of the thick disk in particular with respect to the α-, r- and s-process elements. The principal results are as follows: both stars show significant enhancement in all analysed α-elements, in the r-process element Eu as well as in Al and Zn. Mn and the s-process element Ba are underabundant relative to iron while the other iron-peak elements exhibit a slight enhancement. N, Na, Ce and the r-process element Sr also show a weak overabundance. Based on the very accurate HIPPARCOS astrometry the stellar ages were determined to be 13 Gyrs. This allows us to identify both stars as members of the thick disk which is also in accord with their kinematics. The high Eu/Ba ratios are consistent with the ratio expected for stars older than 12 Gyr under the assumption of r-process dominated enrichment in the early phase of Galactic chemical evolution. We argue that the high [Al/Fe] and [Zn/Fe] ratios potentially allow to spectroscopically distinguish between the halo and thick-disk populations.},

title = {Deep Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 Photometry of M31's Thick Disk (?)},
abstract = {We present deep color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for a field along the outer disk of M31 based on archival Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 observations in the F555W (~V) and F814W (~I) filters. The CMDs, which contain a total of about 50,000 stars, feature a prominent red giant branch (RGB) along with a significant population of helium-burning red clump stars. In addition, they exhibit the rarely seen asymptotic giant branch clump, as well as a weak Population II horizontal branch. There is also the hint of a ~2 Gyr subgiant branch at the faintest levels of the CMDs. After adopting an M31 distance of (m-M)0=24.5 and a reddening of E(B-V)=0.08, we draw the following conclusions. (1) The I-band absolute magnitude of the helium-burning red clump stars is MI(RC)=-0.29+/-0.05, which is in accord with the value derived from Hipparcos parallaxes of solar neighborhood clump stars by Stanek {\&} Garnavich. (2) The metallicity distribution function constructed from bright RGB stars shows a characteristic shape; however, a pure halo population consisting of metal-poor and intermediate-metallicity components (as advocated in the literature) is not sufficient to account for this shape. Instead, an additional Gaussian component with <[Fe/H]>=-0.22+/-0.26, comprising 70% of the total number of stars, is required. (3) A comparison of our CMD with theoretical isochrones indicates that the majority of stars in our M31 field have ages that are >~1.5 Gyr. (4) These points, along with the physical location of our field in M31, suggest that we are observing the thick-disk population of this galaxy.},

title = {The Kinematics of Thick Disks in External Galaxies},
abstract = {We present kinematic measurements of the thick and thin disks in two edge-on galaxies. We have derived stellar rotation curves at and above the galaxies' midplanes using Ca II triplet features measured with the GMOS spectrograph on Gemini North. In one galaxy, FGC 1415, the kinematics above the plane shows clear rotation that lags that of the midplane by ~20%-50%, similar to the behavior seen in the Milky Way. However, the kinematics of the second galaxy, FGC 227, is quite different. The rotation above the plane is extremely slow, showing <~25% of the rotation speed of the stars at the midplane. We decompose the observed rotation curves into a superposition of thick- and thin-disk kinematics, using two-dimensional fits to the galaxy images to determine the fraction of thick-disk stars at each position. We find that the thick disk of FGC 1415 rotates at 30%-40% of the rotation speed of the thin disk. In contrast, the thick disk of FGC 227 is very likely counterrotating if it is rotating at all. These observations are consistent with the velocity dispersion profiles that we measure for each galaxy. The detection of counterrotating thick disks conclusively rules out models in which the thick disk forms either during monolithic collapse or from vertical heating of an earlier thin disk. Instead, the data strongly support models in which the thick disk forms from direct accretion of stars from infalling satellites.},

title = {A Study of Edge-On Galaxies with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. II. Vertical Distribution of the Resolved Stellar Population},
abstract = {We analyze the vertical distribution of the resolved stellar populations in six low-mass (Vmax=67-131 km s-1), edge-on, spiral galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. In each galaxy we find evidence for an extraplanar stellar component extending up to 15 scale heights (3.5 kpc) above the plane, with a scale height typically twice that of two-dimensional fits to Ks-band Two Micron All Sky Survey images. We analyze the vertical distribution as a function of stellar age by tracking changes in the color-magnitude diagram. The young stellar component (<~108 yr) is found to have a scale height larger than the young component in the Milky Way, suggesting that stars in these low-mass galaxies form in a thicker disk. We also find that the scale height of a stellar population increases with age, with young main-sequence stars, intermediate-age asymptotic giant branch stars, and old red giant branch (RGB) stars having successively larger scale heights in each galaxy. This systematic trend indicates that disk heating must play some role in producing the extraplanar stars. We constrain the rate of disk heating using the observed trend between scale height and stellar age and find that the observed heating rates are dramatically smaller than in the Milky Way. The color distributions of the RGB stars well above the midplane indicate that the extended stellar components we see are moderately metal-poor, with peak metallicities around [Fe/H]=-1 and with little or no metallicity gradient with height. The lack of metallicity gradient can be explained if a majority of extraplanar RGB stars were formed at early times and are not dominated by a younger heated population. Our observations suggest that, like the Milky Way, low-mass disk galaxies also have multiple stellar components. In its structure, mean metallicity, and old age, the RGB component in these galaxies seems analogous to the Milky Way thick disk. However, without additional kinematic and abundance measurements, this association is only circumstantial, particularly in light of the clear existence of some disk heating at intermediate ages. Finally, we find that the vertical dust distribution has a scale height somewhat larger than that of the main-sequence stars.},

We extract stellar and ionized gas rotation curves at and above the galaxies' midplanes using the Ca II triplet absorption features and Hα emission lines measured with the GMOS spectrographs on Gemini-North and Gemini-South. For the higher mass galaxies in the sample, we fail to detect differences between the thin- and thick-disk kinematics. In the lower mass galaxies, there is a wide range of thick-disk behavior, including thick disks with substantial lag and one counterrotating thick disk. We compare our rotation curves with expectations from thick-disk formation models and conclude that the wide variety of thick-disk kinematics favors a formation scenario in which thick-disk stars are accreted or formed during merger events as opposed to models that form thick disks through gradual thin-disk heating.},

title = {Intermediate-Band Surface Photometry of the Edge-on Galaxy NGC 4565},
abstract = {We present a deep, 42.79 hr image of the nearby, edge-on galaxy NGC 4565 in the Beijing-Arizona-Taipei-Connecticut 6660 {\AA} band using the large-format CCD system on the 0.6 m Schmidt telescope at the Xinglong Station of the National Astronomical Observatories of China. Following the procedures previously developed by our team for the analysis of deep images of galaxies, we obtain a final image that is calibrated to an accuracy of 0.02 mag in zero point and for which we can measure galaxy surface brightness to an accuracy of 0.25 mag at a surface brightness of 27.5 mag arcsec-2 at 6660 {\AA}, corresponding to a distance of 22 kpc from the center of the disk. The integrated magnitude of NGC 4565 in our filter is m6660=8.99 (=R magnitude of 9.1) to a surface brightness of 28 mag arcsec-2. We analyze the faint outer parts of this galaxy using a two-dimensional model comprised of three components: an exponential thin disk, an exponential thick disk, and a power-law halo. Combined with a need to provide a cutoff radius for the disk, a total of 12 parameters are included in our model. We determine the best values of our model parameters via 10,000 random initial values, 3700 of which converge to final values. We then plot the χ2 for each converged fit versus parameter value for each of the 12 parameters. The thin-disk and thick-disk parameters that we determine here are consistent with those of previous studies of this galaxy. However, our very deep image permits a better determination of the power-law fit to the halo, constraining this power law to be between r-3.2 and r-4.0, with a best-fit value of r-3.88. We find the axis ratio of the halo to be 0.44 and its core radius to be 14.4 kpc (for an adopted distance of 14.5 Mpc). We also agree with others that the bulge of NGC 4565 is fitted well by an exponential luminosity distribution with a scale height similar to that found for the thin disk.},

title = {A Merger-driven Scenario for Cosmological Disk Galaxy Formation},
abstract = {The hierarchical nature of the ΛCDM cosmology poses serious difficulties for the formation of disk galaxies. To help resolve these issues, we describe a new, merger-driven scenario for the cosmological formation of disk galaxies at high redshifts that supplements the standard dissipational collapse model. In this picture, large gaseous disks may be produced from high angular momentum mergers of systems that are gas dominated, i.e., Mgas/(Mgas+M*)>~0.5 at the height of the merger. Pressurization from the multiphase ISM prevents the complete conversion of gas into stars during the merger, and if enough gas remains to form a disk, the remnant eventually resembles a disk galaxy. We perform numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study how supernovae feedback strength, black hole feedback, progenitor gas fraction, merger mass ratio, and orbital geometry impact the formation of remnant disks. We find that disks can build angular momentum through mergers and the degree of rotational support of the baryons in the remnant is primarily related to feedback processes associated with star formation. Disk-dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that are gas dominated at the time of final coalescence. We also show that the formation of rotationally supported stellar systems in mergers is not restricted to idealized orbits, and both gas-rich major and minor mergers can produce disk-dominated stellar remnants. We suggest that the hierarchical nature of the ΛCDM cosmology and the physics of the ISM may act together to form spiral galaxies by building the angular momentum of disks through gas-dominated mergers at high redshifts.},

title = {Radial mixing in galactic discs},
abstract = {We show that spiral waves in galaxy discs churn the stars and gas in a manner that largely preserves the overall angular momentum distribution and leads to little increase in random motion. Changes in the angular momenta of individual stars are typically as large as ~50 per cent over the lifetime of the disc. The changes are concentrated around the corotation radius for an individual spiral wave, but since transient waves with a wide range of pattern speeds develop in rapid succession, the entire disc is affected. This behaviour has profound consequences for the metallicity gradients with radius in both stars and gas, since the interstellar medium is also stirred by the same mechanism. We find observational support for stirring, propose a simple model for the distribution of stars over metallicity and age, and discuss other possible consequences.},

title = {The Metallicity Dependence of RR Lyrae Absolute Magnitudes from Synthetic Horizontal-Branch Models},
abstract = {A grid of synthetic horizontal-branch (SHB) models based on horizontal-branch (HB) evolutionary tracks with improved physics has been constructed to reconsider the theoretical calibration of the dependence of Mv(RR) on metallicity in globular clusters and the slope of the mean <MV(RR)>-[Fe/H] relation. The SHB models confirm Lee's earlier finding that the slope of the <MV(RR)>-[Fe/H] relation is itself a function of the metallicity range considered and that, in addition, for a given [Fe/H] RR Lyrae luminosities depend on HB morphology. This is due to the fact that HB stars pass through the RR Lyrae instability strip at different evolutionary stages, depending on their original position on the HB. At [Fe/H]=-1.9, and for HB type 0, the models yield MV(RR)=0.47+/-0.10. The mean slope for the zero-age HB models is 0.204. Since there is no simple universal relation between Mv(RR) and metallicity that is applicable to all globular clusters, the HB morphology of each individual cluster must be taken into account, in addition to [Fe/H], in deriving the appropriate Mv(RR). Taking HB morphology into account, we find that the slope of the mean <MV(RR)>-[Fe/H] relation varies between 0.36 for the clusters with Galactocentric distances Rgc less than 6 kpc and 0.22 for clusters with 6 kpc<Rgc<=20 kpc. Implications for interpreting observations of field RR Lyrae variables and for absolute globular cluster ages and Galactic chronology are briefly discussed.},

title = {One ring to encompass them all: a giant stellar structure that surrounds the Galaxy},
abstract = {We present evidence that the curious stellar population found by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the Galactic anticentre direction extends to other distant fields that skirt the plane of the Milky Way. New data, taken with the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera, show a similar population, narrowly aligned along the line of sight, but with a galactocentric distance that changes from ~15 to ~20 kpc (over ~100$\,^{\circ}$ on the sky). Despite being narrowly concentrated along the line of sight, the structure is fairly extended vertically out of the plane of the disc, with a vertical scaleheight of 0.75 +/- 0.04 kpc. This finding suggests that the outer rim of the Galaxy ends in a low surface brightness stellar ring. Presently available data do not allow us to ascertain the origin of the structure. One possibility is that it is the wraith of a satellite galaxy devoured long ago by the Milky Way, although our favoured interpretation is that it is a perturbation of the disc, possibly the result of ancient warps. Assuming that the ring is smooth and axisymmetric, the total stellar mass in the structure may amount to ~2 × 108 Msolar up to~109 Msolar.},

abstract = {We present evidence for a ring of stars in the plane of the Milky Way, extending at least from l=180deg to 227$\,^{\circ}$ with turnoff magnitude g~19.5 the ring could encircle the Galaxy. We infer that the low Galactic latitude structure is at a fairly constant distance of R=18+/-2 kpc from the Galactic center above the Galactic plane and has R=20+/-2 kpc in the region sampled below the Galactic plane. The evidence includes 500 Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic radial velocities of stars within 30$\,^{\circ}$ of the plane. The velocity dispersion of the stars associated with this structure is found to be 27 km s-1 at (l,b)=(198deg,-27deg), 22 km s-1 at (l,b)=(225deg,28deg), 30 km s-1 at (l,b)=(188deg,24deg), and 30 km s-1 at (l,b)=(182deg,27deg). The structure rotates in the same prograde direction as the Galactic disk stars but with a circular velocity of 110+/-25 km s-1. The narrow measured velocity dispersion is inconsistent with power-law spheroid or thick-disk populations. We compare the velocity dispersion in this structure with the velocity dispersion of stars in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream, for which we measure a velocity dispersion of 20 km s-1 at (l,b)=(165deg,-55deg). We estimate a preliminary metallicity from the Ca II (K) line and color of the turnoff stars of [Fe/H]=-1.6 with a dispersion of 0.3 dex and note that the turnoff color is consistent with that of the spheroid population. We interpret our measurements as evidence for a tidally disrupted satellite of 2×107 to 5×108 Msolar that rings the Galaxy.},

title = {Outer structure of the Galactic warp and flare: explaining the Canis Major over-density},
abstract = {Aims.In this paper we derive the structure of the Galactic stellar warp and flare. Methods: .We use 2MASS red clump and red giant stars, selected at mean and fixed heliocentric distances of R{\.o}≃3, 7 and 17 kpc. Results: .Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) a clear stellar warp signature is derived for the 3 selected rings, proving that the warp starts already within the solar circle; (ii) the derived stellar warp is consistent (both in amplitude and phase-angle) with that for the Galactic interstellar dust and neutral atomic hydrogen; (iii) the consistency and regularity of the stellar-gaseous warp is traced out to about R_GC˜20 kpc; (iv) the Sun seems not to fall on the line of nodes. The stellar warp phase-angle orientation (φ˜15$\,^{\circ}$) is close to the orientation angle of the Galactic bar and this, most importantly, produces an asymmetric warp for the inner R{\.o}≃3 and 7 kpc rings; (v) a Northern/Southern warp symmetry is observed only for the ring at R{\.o}≃17 kpc, at which the dependency on φ is weakened; (vi) treating a mixture of thin and thick disk stellar populations, we trace the variation with R_GC of the disk thickness (flaring) and derive an almost constant scale-height (~0.65 kpc) within R_GC˜15 kpc. Further out, the disk flaring increase gradually reaching a mean scale-height of ~1.5 kpc at R_GC˜23 kpc; (vii) the derived outer disk warping and flaring provide further robust evidence that there is no disk radial truncation at R_GC˜14 kpc. Conclusions: .In the particular case of the Canis Major (CMa) over-density we confirm its coincidence with the Southern stellar maximum warp occurring near l˜240$\,^{\circ}$ (for R{\.o}≃7 kpc) which brings down the Milky Way mid-plane by ~3$\,^{\circ}$ in this direction. The regularity and consistency of the stellar, gaseous and dust warp argues strongly against a recent merger scenario for Canis Major. We present evidence to conclude that all observed parameters (e.g. number density, radial velocities, proper motion etc) of CMa are consistent with it being a normal Milky Way outer-disk population, thereby leaving no justification for more complex interpretations of its origin. The present analysis or outer disk structure does not provide a conclusive test of the structure or origin of the Monoceros Ring. Nevertheless, we show that a warped flared Milky Way contributes significantly at the locations of the Monoceros Ring. Comparison of outer Milky Way H I and CO properties with those of other galaxies favors the suggestion that complex structures close to planar in outer disks are common, and are a natural aspect of warped and flaring disks.},

title = {VLT Spectroscopy of RR Lyrae Stars in the Sagittarius Tidal Stream},
abstract = {Sixteen RR Lyrae variables from the QUEST survey that lie in the leading arm of the tidal stream from the Sagittarius dSph galaxy have been observed spectroscopically to measure their radial velocities and metal abundances. The systemic velocities of 14 stars, which were determined by fitting a standard velocity curve to the individual measurements, have a sharply peaked distribution with a mean of 33 km s-1 and a standard deviation of only 25 km s-1. The [Fe/H] distribution of these stars has a mean of -1.76 and a standard deviation of 0.22. These measurements are in good agreement with previous ones from smaller samples of stars. The mean metallicity is consistent with the age-metallicity relation that is observed in the main body of the Sgr dSph galaxy. The radial velocities and the distances from the Sun of these stars are compared with recent numerical simulations of the Sgr streams that assume different shapes for the dark matter halo. Models that assume a oblate halo do not fit the data as well as ones that assume a spherical or a prolate distribution. However, none of the fits are completely satisfactory. Every model fails to reproduce the long extent of the stream in right ascension (36$\,^{\circ}$) that is seen in the region covered by the QUEST survey. Further modeling is required to see if this and the other mismatches between theory and observation can be removed by judicial choices for the model parameters or instead rule out a class of models.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative analysis of the star formation history (SFH) of the Local Group dSph galaxy Leo I, from the information in its Hubble Space Telescope [(V-I),I] color-magnitude diagram (CMD). It reaches the level of the oldest main-sequence turnoffs, and this allows us to retrieve the SFH in considerable detail. The method we use is based on comparing, via synthetic CMDs, the expected distribution of stars in the CMD for different evolutionary scenarios with the observed distribution. We consider the SFH to be composed by the SFR(t), the chemical enrichment law Z(t), the initial mass function (IMF), and a function β(f,q) controlling the fraction f and mass ratio distribution q of binary stars. We analyze a set of ~=50 combinations of four Z(t), three IMFs, and more than four β(f,q). For each of them, the best SFR(t) is searched for among ~=6x107 models. The comparison between the observed CMD and the model CMDs is done through χ2ν minimization of the differences in the number of stars in a set of regions of the CMD, chosen to sample stars of different ages or in specific stellar evolutionary phases. We empirically determine the range of χ2ν values that indicate acceptable models for our set of data using tests with models with known SFHs. Our solution for the SFH of Leo I defines a minimum of χ2ν in a well-defined position of the parameter space, and the derived SFR(t) is robust, in the sense that its main characteristics are unchanged for different combinations of the remaining parameters. However, only a narrow range of assumptions for Z(t), IMF, and β(f,q) result in a good agreement between the data and the models, namely, Z=0.0004, a IMF Kroupa et al. or slightly steeper, and a relatively large fraction of binary stars, with f=0.3-0.6, q>0.6, and an approximately flat IMF for the secondaries, or particular combinations of these parameters that would produce a like fraction of similar mass binaries. Most star formation activity (70% to 80%) occurred between 7 and 1 Gyr ago. At 1 Gyr ago, it abruptly dropped to a negligible value, but seems to have been active until at least ~=300 million years ago. Our results do not unambiguously answer the question of whether Leo I began forming stars around 15 Gyr ago, but it appears that the amount of this star formation, if it existed at all, would be small.},

title = {Probing the Canis Major stellar over-density as due to the Galactic warp},
abstract = {Proper-motion, star counts and photometric catalog simulations are used to explain the detected stellar over-density in the region of Canis Major, claimed to be the core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy (CMa, Martin et al. \cite{martin04}, MNRAS, 348, 12; Bellazzini et al. \cite{luna04}, [arXiv:astro-ph/0311119]), as due to the Galactic warp and flare in the external disk. We compare the kinematics of CMa M-giant selected sample with surrounding Galactic disk stars in the UCAC2 catalog and find no peculiar proper motion signature: CMa stars mimic thick disk kinematics. Moreover, when taking into account the Galactic warp and flare of the disk, 2MASS star count profiles reproduce the CMa stellar over-density. This star count analysis is confirmed by direct comparison with synthetic color-magnitude diagrams simulated with the Besan{\c c}on models (Robin et al. \cite{robin03}, A{\&}A, 409, 523) that include the warp and flare of the disk. The presented evidence casts doubt on the identification of the CMa over-density as the core of a disrupted Milky Way satellite. This however does not make clear the origin of over-densities responsible for the ring structure in the anticenter direction of the Galactic halo (Newberg et al. \cite{newberg02}, ApJ, 569, 245; Yanny et al. 2003, ApJ, 588, 824).},

abstract = {We have identified 23 RR Lyrae stars and three possible anomalous Cepheids (ACs) among 84 candidate variables in the recently discovered Canes Venatici I (CVn I) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The mean period of 18 RRab type stars, <Pab>=0.60+/-0.01 days, and the location of these stars in the period-amplitude diagram suggest that CVn I is likely an Oosterhoff-intermediate system. The average apparent magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars, <V>=22.17+/-0.02 mag, gives a distance of 210+7-5 kpc, for an adopted reddening E(B-V)=0.03 mag. We present a B, V color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of CVn I that reaches V~25 mag, and shows that the galaxy has a mainly old stellar population with a metal abundance near [Fe/H] = -2.0 dex. The width of the red giant branch and the location of the candidate ACs on the CMD may indicate that the galaxy hosts a complex stellar population with stars from ~13 Gyr to as young as ~0.6 Gyr.

title = {Spiral structure of the third galactic quadrant and the solution to the Canis Major debate},
abstract = {With the discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal, a galaxy caught in the process of merging with the Milky Way, the hunt for other such accretion events has become a very active field of astrophysical research. The identification of a stellar ring-like structure in Monoceros, spanning more than 100$\,^{\circ}$, and the detection of an overdensity of stars in the direction of the constellation of Canis Major (CMa), apparently associated to the ring, has led to the widespread belief that a second galaxy being cannibalized by the Milky Way had been found. In this scenario, the overdensity would be the remaining core of the disrupted galaxy and the ring would be the tidal debris left behind. However, unlike the Sagittarius dwarf, which is well below the Galactic plane and whose orbit, and thus tidal tail, is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the Milky Way, the putative CMa galaxy and ring are nearly co-planar with the Galactic disc. This severely complicates the interpretation of observations. In this Letter, we show that our new description of the Milky Way leads to a completely different picture. We argue that the Norma-Cygnus spiral arm defines a distant stellar ring crossing Monoceros and the overdensity is simply a projection effect of looking along the nearby local arm. Our perspective sheds new light on a very poorly known region, the third Galactic quadrant, where CMa is located.},

Likely main-sequence stars in CMa have been selected from a region in the color-magnitude diagram that has very little contamination from known Milky Way components. We obtain μlcosb=-1.47+/-0.37 and μb=-1.07+/-0.38 mas yr-1, on the International Celestial Reference System by means of Hipparcos stars. Together with the radial velocity of 109 km s-1 and the assumed distance of 8 kpc, these results imply a space motion of (Π,Θ,W)=(-5+/-12, 188+/-10, -49+/-15) km s-1. While CMa has in-plane rotation similar to the mean of thick-disk stars, it shows significant (3 σ) motion perpendicular to the disk and differs even more (7 σ) from that expected for the Galactic warp. The W-velocity lends support to the argument that the CMa overdensity is part of a satellite-galaxy remnant.},

abstract = {Overdensities in the distribution of low-latitude, 2MASS giant stars are revealed by systematically peeling away from sky maps the bulk of the giant stars conforming to ``isotropic'' density laws generally accounting for known Milky Way components. This procedure, combined with a higher resolution treatment of the sky density of both giants and dust, allows us to probe to lower Galactic latitudes than previous 2MASS giant star studies. While the results show the swath of excess giants previously associated with the Monoceros ring system in the second and third Galactic quadrants at distances of 6-20 kpc, we also find a several times larger overdensity of giants in the same distance range concentrated in the direction of the ancient constellation Argo. Isodensity contours of the large structure suggest that it is highly elongated and inclined by about 3$\,^{\circ}$ to the disk, although details of the structure-including the actual location of highest density, overall extent, true shape-and its origin remain unknown because only a fraction of it lies outside highly dust-obscured, low-latitude regions. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the 2MASS M giant overdensity previously claimed to represent the core of a dwarf galaxy in Canis Major (l~240deg) is an artifact of a dust extinction window opening to the overall density rise to the more significant Argo structure centered at larger longitude (l~290deg+/-10deg, b~-4deg+/-2deg).},

The pulsational properties of the RR Lyrae conform closely to period-abundance trends extrapolated from more metal-rich populations. We estimate the distance of Bo{\"o}tes to be (m-M)0=18.96+/-0.12. The average RRab period (0.69 days), the fraction of type c pulsators (0.53), and the RRab period shift (-0.07) indicate an Oosterhoff type II classification for Bo{\"o}tes, a marked contrast to other dSph galaxies, which are mostly Oosterhoff intermediate. This supports the contention that the Oosterhoff dichotomy is a continuum-that RR Lyrae properties, to first order, vary smoothly with abundance. The dSph galaxies are not distinct from Galactic globular clusters but bridge the Oosterhoff gap. In contrast to other dSph galaxies, Bo{\"o}tes lacks any anomalous Cepheids.},

title = {New Findings for the Blue Plume Stars in the Canis Major Over-Density},
abstract = {We obtained new UBV photometry and spectroscopy of Blue Plume (BP) stars in fields near the center of the Canis Major Over-Density (CMa). We combined analysis of the color-color diagrams with a new comparison of the hydrogen Balmer-line profile to the reddening-free Q parameter to improve the reddening and extinction estimates for this low-latitude, differentially reddened, area of the sky. Results of our stellar parameter analysis for B/A spectral type stars associated with the BP show that the majority of the stars have main-sequence surface gravities placing them at an average heliocentric distance of <D> = 6.0 +/- 2.7 kpc. This distance is more consistent with membership in the intervening Perseus spiral arm and strongly suggests that the BP stars are not associated with the other stellar populations previously reported to make up the CMa. This result casts serious doubt on the proposed dwarf galaxy origin for the CMa.},

title = {Searching for RR Lyrae stars in the Canis Major overdensity},
abstract = {The Canis Major overdensity (CMa) was initially proposed to be the remnant of a tidally disrupting dSph galaxy. Since its nature is still subject of debate, the goal of the present work was to conduct a large-scale RR Lyrae survey in CMa, in order to see if there is an overdensity of these stars. The survey spans a total area of ~34 sq. deg. with observations in V and R filters, made with the 1.0m Jurgen Stock Schmidt telescope at the National Astronomical Observatory of Venezuela. Current results in a subregion, including spectroscopic observations, show that the small number of RR Lyrae stars found can be accounted for by the halo and thick disk components of our Galaxy.},

abstract = {This paper concludes a systematic search for evidence of the Monoceros Ring and Canis Major dwarf galaxy around the Galactic plane. Presented here are the results for the Galactic longitude range of l = (280-025)$\,^{\circ}$. Testing the claim that the Monoceros Ring encircles the entire Galaxy, this survey attempts to document the position of the Monoceros Ring with increasing Galactic longitude. Additionally, with the discovery of the purported Canis Major dwarf galaxy, searching for more evidence of its interaction is imperative for tracing its path through the Galaxy and understanding its role in the evolution of the Milky Way. Two new detections of the Monoceros Ring have been found at (l, b) = (280, +15)$\,^{\circ}$ and (300, +10)$\,^{\circ}$. Interestingly, in general, there seem to be more detections above the plane than below it; in this survey, around 2/3 of the firm Monoceros Ring detections are in the north. This coincides with the northern detections appearing to be qualitatively denser and broader than their southern counterparts. The maximum of the Galactic warp in the south is also probed in this survey. It is found that these fields do not resemble those in the Canis Major region suggesting that the warp does not change the shape of the colour-magnitude diagram as is witnessed around Canis Major. The origins and morphology of the Monoceros Ring are still elusive primarily due to its enormous extent on the sky. Continued probing of the Galactic Outer Disc is needed before a consensus can be reached on its nature.},

abstract = {We report on the detection of main-sequence stars belonging to the recently identified Canis Major (CMa) galaxy in a field located at ~=4.$\,^{\circ}$2 from the centre of the stellar system. With main-sequence fitting we obtain a distance modulus (m-M)0= 14.5 +/- 0.3 to the dwarf, corresponding to a distance of Dsolar~= 8.0 +/- 1.2 kpc, in full agreement with previous estimates based on the photometric parallax of M-giants. From the comparison with theoretical isochrones, we constrain the age of the main population of the CMa system in the range ~4-10 Gyr. A blue plume of likely younger stars (age <1-2 Gyr) is also identified. The available colour-magnitude diagrams of open clusters that may be projected on to the main body of CMa are also briefly analysed. The position, distance and stellar population of the old open clusters Arp-Madore 2 and Tombaugh 2 strongly suggest that they are physically associated with the CMa galaxy. Using our own photometry and data from the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey and the Guide Star Catalogue 2.2 we demonstrate that the claim by Momany et al. that the CMa overdensity is entirely due to the Galactic warp is not supported by the existing observations, once all the available pieces of information are taken into account. It is shown that the CMa overdensity clearly emerges at a heliocentric distance of ~8 kpc above any overdensity possibly produced by the Galactic warp.},

title = {HST/ACS observations of the old and metal-poor Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy},
abstract = {We have obtained deep color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The new diagrams show for the first time the star formation history of SagDIG. The young main-sequence is traced down to mF606W ≃27.5, well separated from the older He burning blue loop stars. The wide color range spanned by the blue and red super-giants is consistent with Padua evolutionary models with Z˜0.0004. A well-defined red giant branch indicates that the galaxy is dominated by a stellar population older than 1 Gyr, for which we have estimated a metallicity in the range [ Fe/H] = -2.2 to -1.9 depending on the adopted reddening. The identification of several C stars on a luminous asymptotic giant branch, as well as the presence of a conspicuous red clump with an elongated structure, are indicative of an extended star formation epoch between 1 and 10 Gyr ago. Perhaps most importantly, we have identified a small population of stars on a genuinely old red horizontal branch at mF606W =25.70$\pm$0.05, which sets the first epoch of star formation in SagDIG back to 9{-}10 Gyr ago. This shows that SagDIG has been able to maintain a very low mean metallicity over a 10 Gyr life time, and that all Local Group dwarf galaxies share an ancient (≥10 Gyr) initial episode of star formation. Thus, at the moment, I Zw 18 remains the only exception to this general trend, favoring the so-called "young galaxy" scenario where a very low metallicity galaxy is not necessarily old. However, a re-analysis of ACS observations of I Zw 18 suggests that an older RGB population may be present also in I Zw 18. In order to address the interplay between stars and Inter-Stellar Medium, we compare the distribution of atomic hydrogen with that of stellar populations of various ages. The youngest stars are found in clumps located: (i) near to, but not coincident with, the highest column densities of H I, and (ii) in tails reminiscent of propagating star formation. We find, however, little correlation between stellar populations older than 1 Gyr and the H I. In particular we fail to find any generation of stars that preferentially lie within the large H I hole. We therefore exclude the possibility that the ring-like H I distribution is the result of multiple supernova events. Alternative scenarios have to be explored for the ring-like H I morphology of SagDIG, which amongst dwarf irregular galaxies, is not unusual.},

title = {Re-affirming the connection between the Galactic stellar warp and the Canis Major over-density},
abstract = {Aims:We aim to understand the real nature of the stellar overdensity at southern galactic latitudes in the region of CMa. Methods: We perform a critical re-analysis and discussion of recent results presented in the literature which interpret the CMa overdensity as the signature of an accreting dwarf galaxy or a new substructure within the Galaxy. Several issues are addressed. Results: We show that arguments against the ``warp'' interpretation are based on an erroneous perception of the Milky Way. There is nothing anomalous with colour-magnitude diagrams on opposite sides of the average warp mid-plane being different. We witnessed the rise and fall of the blue plume population, first attributed to young stars in a disrupting dwarf galaxy and now discarded as a normal disc population. Similarly, there is nothing anomalous in the outer thin+thick disc metallicities being low (-1 < [Fe/H] < -0.5), and spiral arms (as part of the thin disc) should, and do, warp. Most importantly, we show unambiguously that, contrary to previous claims, the warp produces a stellar overdensity that is distance-compatible with that observed in CMa. Conclusions: The CMa over-density remains fully accounted for in a first order approach by Galactic models without new substructures. Given the intrinsic uncertainties (concerning the properties of the warp, flare and disc cutoff, the role of extinction and degeneracy), minor deviations with respect to these models are not enough to support the hypothesis of an accreted dwarf galaxy or new substructure within the Milky Way disc.},

title = {RR Lyrae Variable Stars in the Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy Leo I},
abstract = {We report the discovery of a significant population of RR Lyrae variable stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Leo I. Based on 40 V and 22 B images of the galaxy taken using the ESO Wide-Field Imager, we have so far identified 74 candidate RR Lyrae stars in two CCDs hosting the main body of the galaxy. Full coverage of the light variations and pulsation periods have been obtained for 54 of them, 47 of which are Bailey ab-type RR Lyrae (RRab) stars and seven are c-type RR Lyrae (RRc) stars. The period distribution of the presently confirmed sample of RRab stars peaks at P=0.60 days, with a minimum period of 0.54 days. The pulsational properties indicate an intermediate Oosterhoff type for Leo I, similar to other dwarf galaxies in the Local Group and the LMC. However, the rather long minimum period of the ab-type variable stars, and the significant number of RRab stars with long period and large amplitude, suggest that the bulk of the old population in Leo I is more like the Oosterhoff type II globular clusters. The most straightforward interpretation is that a range in metallicity is present among the RR Lyrae stars of Leo I, with a significant population of very metal-poor stars. Alternatively, these Oosterhoff type II variable stars could be more evolved. The average apparent magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars across the full cycle is <V(RR)>=22.60+/-0.12 mag, yielding a distance modulus (m-M)V,0=22.04 +/- 0.14 mag for Leo I on the ``long'' distance scale.

title = {The core of the Canis Major galaxy as traced by red clump stars},
abstract = {The recently discovered stellar system in Canis Major is analysed using He-burning red clump stars as tracers. Canis Major turns out to be the strongest and the most spatially confined overdensity of the whole Galactic disc, in terms of both number density and statistical significance. When projected on to the Galactic plane, it appears as an elongated and compact overdensity extending from l~ 200$\,^{\circ}$ to 280$\,^{\circ}$ with a roundish core towards l~ 240$\,^{\circ}$. We find that the main body of the system has an integrated absolute magnitude MV=-14.4 +/- 0.8, a central surface brightness μV,0~= 24.0 +/- 0.6 and a line-of-sight (LOS) profile peaked at Dsolar= 7.2 +/- 1.0kpc with half width at half maximum ~ 2.0kpc, in excellent agreement with the results obtained with widely different tracers (M giants and main-sequence stars) in previous analyses. The mean distance to the main body of Canis Major is observed to increase with increasing Galactic longitude, from Dsolar~= 6.3kpc at l~= 225$\,^{\circ}$ to Dsolar~= 9.3kpc at l~= 265$\,^{\circ}$, in good agreement with the predictions of our more recent N-body simulation that models Canis Major (CMa) as a dwarf galaxy being accreted in a planar orbit on to the disc of the Milky Way. We confirm that the Canis Major system has all the characteristics of the relic of a dwarf galaxy seen on top of a large-scale overdensity that we detect all over the third and fourth Galactic quadrants (180$\,^{\circ}$<=l<= 360$\,^{\circ}$, with a strong maximum around l= 290$\,^{\circ}$ and b>~-5$\,^{\circ}$) that is identified as the stellar component of the Southern Galactic warp. On the other hand, the possibility that a peculiar deformation/asymmetry of the outer Galactic disc may be at the origin of the observed distribution of overdensities towards CMa cannot be definitely ruled out with the data presented in this paper. We also address a recent claim that Canis Major is on the outskirts of a larger `Argo' structure centred at l~= 290$\,^{\circ}$. Our analysis shows that the stellar populations in the latter are distributed over a very large distance range along the LOS, and do not give rise to a narrow peak in density in this direction, contrary to what is observed in Canis Major. This suggests that the Argo structure is likely due to Galactic asymmetries such as the warp.},

title = {Detection of a Young Stellar Population in the Background of Open Clusters in the Third Galactic Quadrant},
abstract = {We report the detection of a young stellar population (<=100 Myr) in the background of nine young open clusters belonging to a homogenous sample of 30 star clusters in the third Galactic quadrant (at 217deg<=l<=260deg). Deep and accurate UBVRI photometry allows us to measure model-independent age and distance for the clusters and the background population with high confidence. This population is exactly the same population (the blue plume) recently detected in three intermediate-age open clusters and suggested to be a <=1-2 Gyr old population belonging to the Canis Major (CMa) overdensity (Bellazzini et al.; Mart{\'\i}nez-Delgado et al.). However, we find that the young population in those three clusters and in six clusters of our sample follows the pattern of the Norma-Cygnus spiral arm as defined by CO clouds remarkably well, while in the other three program clusters it lies in the Perseus arm. We finally provide one example (out of 21) of a cluster that does not show any background population, demonstrating that this population is not ubiquitous toward CMa.},

title = {Modeling the Stellar Populations in the Canis Major Overdensity: The Relation between the Old and Young Populations},
abstract = {We analyze the stellar populations of the Canis Major stellar overdensity using quantitative color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting techniques. The analysis is based on photometry obtained with the Wide Field Imager at the 2.2 m telescope at La Silla for several fields near the probable center of the overdensity. A modified version of the MATCH software package was applied to fit the observed CMDs, enabling us to constrain the properties of the old and young stellar populations that appear to be present. For the old population we find [Fe/H]~-1.0, a distance of ~7.5 kpc, a line-of-sight depth σlos of 1.5+/-0.2 kpc, and a characteristic age range of 3-6 Gyr. However, the spread in ages and the possible presence of a ~10 Gyr old population cannot be constrained. The young main sequence is found to have an age spread; ages must range from a few hundred Myr to 2 Gyr. Because of the degeneracy between distance and metallicity in CMDs, the estimates of these parameters are strongly correlated, and two scenarios are consistent with the data: if the young stars have a metallicity similar to the old stars, they are equidistant and therefore cospatial with the old stars; if the young stars have close to solar metallicity they are more distant (~9 kpc). The relatively low metallicity of the old main sequence favors the interpretation that CMa is the remnant of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Spectroscopic metallicity measurements are needed to determine whether the young main sequence is cospatial.},

The data for the two clusters were obtained during the same photometric nights with the same instrument, allowing us to determine accurate relative ages. Based on a differential comparison of the CMDs using the Δ(B-V) method, an age difference of 1.7+/-0.7 Gyr is obtained between these two clusters. We compare this result with our updated horizontal-branch (HB) population models, which confirm that the observed age difference can produce the difference in HB morphology between the clusters. This provides further evidence that age is the dominant second parameter that influences HB morphology. Data were obtained using the 2.4 m Hiltner Telescope of the Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT (MDM) Observatory.},

To complement the discussion and to serve as a foundation for future work, I present an extensive set of basic observational data in tables that summarize much of what we know and still do not know about these nearby dwarfs. Our understanding of these galaxies has grown impressively in the past decade, but fundamental puzzles remain that will keep the Local Group at the forefront of galaxy evolution studies for some time.},

title = {The Closest View of a Dwarf Galaxy: New Evidence on the Nature of the Canis Major Overdensity},
abstract = {We present the first deep color-magnitude diagram of the putative central region (0.5d×0.5d) of the Canis Major stellar overdensity (l, b)=(240, -8) found recently by Martin and coworkers, which has been proposed as the remnant of a dwarf satellite accreted onto the Milky Way on a near-equatorial orbit. We find a narrow (in apparent magnitude) main sequence extending 6 mag below the turnoff to our limiting magnitude of B~24.5 mag. This main sequence has very high contrast (>3) with respect to the thin/thick disk/halo background; its narrowness at brighter magnitudes clearly implies the presence of a distinct and possibly still bound stellar system. We derived the line-of-sight size (r1/2) of this system based on the B-band width of the lower main sequence, obtaining 0.94+/-0.18 (random)+/-0.18 (systematic) kpc. That size matches a model prediction for the main body of the parent galaxy of the Monoceros tidal stream. The high-density contrast and limited spatial extent in the radial direction are very hard to reconcile with the alternative explanation put forward to explain the Canis Major stellar overdensity: a flared or warped Galactic disk viewed in projection, as found in the recent work of Momany and coworkers. We also derived a central surface brightness of μV,0=23.3+/-0.1 mag arcsec-2 and an absolute magnitude of MV=-14.5+/-0.1 mag. These values place the Canis Major object in the category of dwarf galaxy, considering the LV-size and MV-μV planes for such objects. However, like the Sagittarius dwarf, it is an outlier in the [Fe/H]-MV plane in the sense that it is too metal-rich for its estimated absolute magnitude. This suggests that the main mechanism driving its recent and current star formation history (possibly tidal stripping) is different from that of isolated dwarfs.},

title = {A dwarf galaxy remnant in Canis Major: the fossil of an in-plane accretion on to the Milky Way},
abstract = {We present an analysis of the asymmetries in the population of Galactic M-giant stars present in the 2MASS All Sky catalogue. Several large-scale asymmetries are detected, the most significant of which is a strong elliptical-shaped stellar overdensity, close to the Galactic plane at (l= 240$\,^{\circ}$, b=-8$\,^{\circ}$), in the constellation of Canis Major. A small grouping of globular clusters (NGC 1851, 1904, 2298 and 2808), coincident in position and radial velocity, surround this structure, as do a number of open clusters. The population of M-giant stars in this overdensity is similar in number to that in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. We argue that this object is the likely dwarf galaxy progenitor of the ring-like structure that has recently been found at the edge of the Galactic disc. A numerical study of the tidal disruption of an accreted dwarf galaxy is presented. The simulated debris fits the extant position, distance and velocity information on the Galactic `Ring', as well as that of the M-giant overdensities, suggesting that all these structures are the consequence of a single accretion event. The disrupted dwarf galaxy stream orbits close to the Galactic plane, with a pericentre at approximately the solar circle, an orbital eccentricity similar to that of stars in the Galactic thick disc, as well as a vertical scaleheight similar to that of the thick disc. This finding strongly suggests that the Canis Major dwarf galaxy is a building block of the Galactic thick disc, that the thick disc is continually growing, even up to the present time, and that thick disc globular clusters were accreted on to the Milky Way from dwarf galaxies in co-planar orbits.},

title = {Galactic halo stellar structures in the Triangulum-Andromeda region},
abstract = {This letter reports on the Galactic stellar structures that appear in the foreground of our Canada-France-Hawaii-Telecopse/MegaCam survey of the halo of the Andromeda galaxy. We recover the main sequence and main sequence turn-off of the Triangulum-Andromeda structure recently found by Majewski and collaborators at a heliocentric distance of ~20 kpc. The survey also reveals another less populated main sequence at fainter magnitudes that could correspond to a more distant stellar structure at ~28 kpc. Both main sequences are smoothly distributed over the ~54 deg^2 covered by the survey but they show a density increase toward the Galactic plane that does not appear to be due to contamination from the Galactic disk or stellar halo. The discovery of a stellar structure behind the Triangulum-Andromeda structure that itself appears behind the low-latitude stream that surrounds the Galactic disk gives further evidence that the inner halo of the Milky Way is of a spatially clumpy nature.},

title = {A radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude structures - I. Kinematics of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy},
abstract = {As part of a radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude structures that we undertook with the 2dF spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, we present the radial velocities of more than 1500 red giant branch and red clump stars towards the centre of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy. With a mean velocity of 72 +/- 7kms-1 at a heliocentric distance of 5.5kpc and 114 +/- 2kms-1 at 8.5kpc, these stars present a peculiar distance - radial velocity relation that is unlike that expected from thin or thick disc stars. Moreover, they belong to a kinematically cold population with an intrinsic dispersion that may be as low as 11+3-1kms-1. A comparison of the velocity distribution obtained in this work with previous studies shows the importance of using our new reduction pipeline and averaging the velocities obtained from different templates. The radial velocity distribution is used to select Canis Major stars in the UCAC2.0 proper motion catalogue and derive proper motions in Galactic coordinates of (μl, μb) = (-3.6 +/- 0.8masyr-1, 1.5 +/- 0.4masyr-1) for the dwarf galaxy, which after correcting for the reflex solar motion along this line of sight gives (μ'l, μ'b) = (-6.8 +/- 0.8masyr-1, 0.8 +/- 0.4masyr-1), corresponding to a prograde orbit with a tangential velocity of ~235kms-1 at the average distance of ~7.2kpc. All these kinematic constraints can be reproduced in simulations of the accretion of a dwarf on to the Galactic disc. Such a process could also be responsible for the Monoceros Ring that has recently been shown to encompass the Galactic disc. However, without constraints on the kinematics of the tidal arms emerging from the Canis Major dwarf, it is not yet possible to definitively prove a link between the two structures.},

title = {Why the Canis Major overdensity is not due to the Warp: analysis of its radial profile and velocities},
abstract = {In response to recent criticism by Momany et al., that the recently identified Canis Major (CMa) overdensity could be simply explained by the Galactic warp, we present proof of the existence of a stellar population in the direction of CMa that cannot be explained by known Galactic components. By analysing the radial distribution of counts of M-giant stars in this direction, we show that the Momany et al. warp model overestimates the number of stars in the Northern hemisphere, hence hiding the CMa feature in the South. The use of a better model of the warp has little influence on the morphology of the overdensity and clearly displays an excess of stars grouped at a distance of D= 7.2 +/- 0.3 kpc. To lend further support to the existence of a population that does not belong to the Galactic disc, we present radial velocities of M-giant stars in the centre of the CMa structure that were obtained with the 2dF spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The extra population shows a radial velocity of vr= 109 +/- 4 km s-1, which is significantly higher than the typical velocity of the disc at the distance of CMa. This population also has a low dispersion (13 +/- 4 kms-1). The Canis Major overdensity is therefore highly unlikely to be due to the Galactic warp, adding weight to the hypothesis that we are observing a disrupting dwarf galaxy or its remnants. This leads to questions on what part of CMa was previously identified as the Warp and how possibly to disentangle the two structures.},

title = {Galactic warp in the overdensity of the Canis Major region},
abstract = {Bellazzini et al. claim that L{\'o}pez-Corredoira et al. warp model is totally unable to reproduce the Canis Major structure in the red clump stars. However, slight variations in the azimuth of the L{\'o}pez-Corredoira et al. warp model, justified by the uncertainties in the parameter as well as the local irregularities with respect to the average model, derive a result much closer to the observations of the overdensity south/north. The bump of red clump stars with mK = 13-13.5 around l = 241$\,^{\circ}$,b = -8.5$\,^{\circ}$ and the depth of the Canis Major structure are also explainable in terms of the warp with an appropriate extrapolation of constant height between Galactocentric radii of 13 and 16 kpc, as observed roughly in the southern warp, instead of a monotonically increasing height like the northern warp; and the observed velocity distribution of stars cannot exclude the warp possibility. A warp model is therefore still a possible explanation of the Canis Major overdensity, and the hypothesis of the existence of a dwarf galaxy is unnecessary, although still a possibility too.},

title = {The horizontal-branch stars in globular clusters. 2: The second parameter phenomenon},
abstract = {Using synthetic horizontal-branch models, we have investigated the origin of the systematic variation in horizontal-branch (HB) morphology with galactocentric distance (RG) among globular clusters. The variations in He abundance, CNO abundance, and core mass required separately to explain this effect are inconsistent with either the observed properties of the RR Lyrae variables or the observed main-sequence turnoffs in the clusters. There is also no clear evidence that the trend with RG is related to the central concentrations, central densities, or absolute magnitudes of the clusters. The variations in cluster age required to explain this effect are not in conflict with any observations. A detailed comparison of our synthetic HB calculations with pairs of clusters of very different HB morphology but similar (Fe/H) reveals reasonably good agreement between the age differences inferred from HB morphology and the main-sequence turnoff. The major source of uncertainty is the need for ad hoc hypotheses in the modeling of the HB morphologies of a few peculiar clusters (e.g., NGC 6752). Nonetheless, there is firm evidence for age variations of several gigayears (as much as approximately 5 Gyr) among the halo globular clusters. Our results support the hypothesis of Searle {\&} Zinn that the inner halo is more uniform in age and is older in the mean than the outer halo, and we estimate this difference to be approximately 2 Gyr.},

abstract = {The second version of the USNO-A catalog is now available. The principle difference between it and V1.0 is the adoption of the ICRF as the astrometric frame of reference (the "Hipparcos reference frame" to the non-specialist) as realized by the ACT catalog (Urban et al. 1997). It incorporates new astrometric and photometric algorithms and reductions, an improved treatment of the systematic astrometric residuals from the various Schmidt telescopes, numerical refocusing of the Precision Measuring Machine, and the removal of magnitude equation from the astrometric residuals. The primary distribution mechanism is electronic (FTP to ftp.nofs.navy.mil), but CD-ROM copies are available for bandwidth challenged users. The new version is slightly larger than the previous one because the shift between southern and northern surveys has been moved from -33 to -17 degrees of declination. Although it is based on the same raw detection database as the earlier version, USNO-A2.0 should have smaller systematic errors because of the astrometric and bright photometric calibrations offered by the ACT catalog.},

The surface brightness profiles are reliable (1 σ uncertainty less than 0.2 mag) down to μ˜27 mag/''. Only ~10% of all galaxies have a normal/standard purely exponential disk down to our noise limit. The surface brightness distribution of the rest of the galaxies is better described as a broken exponential. About 60% of the galaxies have a break in the exponential profile between ˜ 1.5-4.5 times the scalelength followed by a downbending, steeper outer region. Another ~30% shows also a clear break between ˜ 4.0-6.0 times the scalelength but followed by an upbending, shallower outer region. A few galaxies have even a more complex surface brightness distribution. The shape of the profiles correlates with Hubble type. Downbending breaks are more frequent in later Hubble types while the fraction of upbending breaks rises towards earlier types. No clear relation is found between the environment, as characterised by the number of neighbours, and the shape of the profiles of the galaxies.},

Are these observations consistent with a cosmology in which structures form hierarchically? To probe this question, we employ SPH/N-body galaxy-scale simulations of late-type galaxies. We examine the evolution of these simulated disk galaxies from redshift 1 to 0, looking at the mass-size and luminosity-size relations, and the thickness parameter, defined as the ratio of scale height to scale length. The structural parameters of our simulated disks settle down quickly, and after redshift z=1 the galaxies evolve to become only slightly flatter. Our simulated present-day galaxies are larger, more massive, less bright, and redder than at z=1.

title = {The Genesis of the Milky Way's Thick Disk via Stellar Migration},
abstract = {The separation of the Milky Way disk into a thin and thick component is supported by differences in the spatial, kinematic and metallicity distributions of their stars. These differences have led to the view that the thick disk formed early via a cataclysmic event and constitutes fossil evidence of the hierarchical growth of the Milky Way. We show here, using N-body simulations, how a double-exponential vertical structure, with stellar populations displaying similar dichotomies can arise purely through internal evolution. In this picture, stars migrate radially, while retaining nearly circular orbits, as described by Sellwood {\&} Binney (2002). As stars move outwards they populate a thickened component. Such stars found at the present time in the solar neighborhood formed early in the disk's history at smaller radii where stars are more metal-poor and alpha-enhanced, leading to the properties observed for thick disk stars. Classifying stars as members of the thin or thick disk by either velocity or metallicity leads to an apparent separation in the other property as observed. This scenario is supported by the SDSS observation that stars in the transition region do not show any correlation between rotational velocity and metallicity. The good qualitative agreement between our simulation and observations in the Milky Way hint that the thick disk may be a ubiquitous galaxy feature generated by stellar migration. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that some fraction of the thick disk is a fossil of a past more violent history, nor can this scenario explain thick disks in all galaxies.},

title = {On the Accretion Origin of a Vast Extended Stellar Disk around the Andromeda Galaxy},
abstract = {We present the discovery of an inhomogenous, low surface brightness, extended disklike structure around the Andromeda galaxy (M31) based on a large kinematic survey of more than 2800 stars with the Keck DEIMOS multiobject spectrograph. The stellar structure spans radii from 15 kpc out to ~40 kpc, with detections out to R~70 kpc. The constituent stars have velocities close to the expected velocity of circular orbits in the plane of the M31 disk and typically have a velocity dispersion of ~30 km s-1. The color range on the upper red giant branch shows a large spread indicative of a population with a significant range of metallicity. The mean metallicity of the population, measured from Ca II equivalent widths, is [Fe/H]=-0.9+/-0.2. The morphology of the structure is irregular at large radii and shows a wealth of substructures that must be transitory in nature and are almost certainly tidal debris. The presence of these substructures indicates that the global entity was formed by accretion. This extended disk follows smoothly on from the central parts of M31 disk out to ~40 kpc with an exponential density law with a scale length of 5.1+/-0.1 kpc, which is similar to that of the bright inner disk. However, the population possesses similar kinematic and abundance properties over the entire region where it is detected in the survey. We estimate that the structure accounts for approximately 10% of the total luminosity of the M31 disk, and given the huge scale, contains ~30% of the total disk angular momentum. This finding indicates that at least some galactic stellar disks are vastly larger than previously thought and are formed, at least in their outer regions, primarily by accretion.},

title = {Antitruncation of Disks in Early-Type Barred Galaxies},
abstract = {The disks of spiral galaxies are commonly thought to be truncated: the radial surface brightness profile steepens sharply beyond a certain radius (3-5 inner disk scale lengths). Here we present the radial brightness profiles of a number of barred S0-Sb galaxies with the opposite behavior: their outer profiles are distinctly shallower in slope than the main disk profile. We term these ``antitruncations'' they are found in at least 25% of a larger sample of barred S0-Sb galaxies. There are two distinct types of antitruncations. About one-third show a fairly gradual transition and outer isophotes that are progressively rounder than the main disk isophotes, suggestive of a disk embedded within a more spheroidal outer zone-either the outer extent of the bulge or a separate stellar halo. But the majority of the profiles have rather sharp surface brightness transitions to the shallower, outer exponential profile and, crucially, outer isophotes that are not significantly rounder than the main disk; in the Sab-Sb galaxies, the outer isophotes include visible spiral arms. This suggests that the outer light is still part of the disk. A subset of these profiles are in galaxies with asymmetric outer isophotes (lopsided or one-armed spirals), suggesting that interactions may be responsible for at least some of the disklike antitruncations.},

title = {The MACHO Project Large Magellanic Cloud Variable Star Inventory. XI. Frequency Analysis of the Fundamental-Mode RR Lyrae Stars},
abstract = {We have frequency-analyzed 6391 variables classified earlier as fundamental-mode RR Lyrae (RR0) stars in the MACHO database on the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The overwhelming majority (i.e., 96%) of these variables have been proved to be indeed RR0 stars, whereas the remaining ones have fallen into one of the following categories: single- and double-mode Cepheids, binaries, first-overtone and double-mode RR Lyrae stars, and nonclassified variables. Special attention has been paid to the properties of the amplitude- and phase-modulated RR0 stars (the Blazhko stars). We found altogether 731 Blazhko variables showing either a doublet or an equidistant triplet pattern at the main pulsation component in their frequency spectra. This sample overwhelmingly exceeds the number of Blazhko stars known in all other systems combined. The incidence rate of the Blazhko variables among the RR0 stars in the LMC is 11.9%, which is 3 times higher than their rate among the first-overtone RR Lyrae stars. No difference is found in the average brightness between the single-mode and Blazhko variables. However, the latter ones show a somewhat lower degree of skewness in their average light curves and a concomitant lower total amplitude in their modulation-free light curves. From the frequency spectra we found that variables with larger modulation amplitudes at the higher frequency side of the main pulsation component are 3 times more common than the ones showing the opposite amplitude pattern. A search for a modulation component with the Blazhko period in the average brightness of the individual variables showed the existence of such a modulation with an overall amplitude of ~0.006 mag. On the other hand, a similar search for quadruple modulation patterns around the main pulsation component has failed to clearly detect such components at the ~0.004 mag level. This means that the amplitudes of the quadruple components (if they exist) should be, on average, at least 10 times smaller than those of the triplet components. This finding and the existence of Blazhko variables with highly asymmetric modulation amplitudes not only question the validity of the magnetic oblique rotator model but also put stringent constraints on models based on mode-coupling theories.},

Our database presently contains about 80 billion photometric measurements, a significant fraction of all astronomical photometry. We describe the calibration of MACHO two-color photometry and transformation to the standard Kron-Cousins V and R system. Calibrated MACHO photometry may be properly compared with all other observations on the Kron-Cousins standard system, enhancing the astrophysical value of these data. For ~9 million stars in the LMC bar, independent photometric measurements of ~20,000 stars with V<~18 mag in field-overlap regions demonstrate an internal precision σV=0.021, σR=0.019, σV-R=0.028 mag. The accuracy of the zero point in this calibration is estimated to be +/-0.035 mag for stars with colors in the range -0.1 mag<V-R<1.2 mag. A comparison of calibrated MACHO photometry with published photometric sequences and new Hubble Space Telescope observations shows agreement. The current calibration zero-point uncertainty for the remainder of the MACHO photometry database is estimated to be +/-0.10 mag in V or R and +/-0.04 mag in V-R. We describe the first application of calibrated MACHO data: the construction of a color-magnitude diagram used to calculate our experimental sensitivity for detecting microlensing in the LMC.},

For 127 of these we present observed minus calculated (O-C) diagrams. The data were acquired on observing runs in 1992 May, 1993 April, and 1997 June. In all 189 BV pairs were obtained. Estimates of fundamental photometric parameters are presented, including intensity- and magnitude-averaged B and V magnitudes and magnitude-averaged colors, pulsation periods, and pulsation amplitudes. In many cases we find periods substantially different from those previously reported. For 30 variables, periods are reported here for the first time. A color-magnitude diagram is given in which the regions occupied by RRab and RRc variables show little or no overlap with each other or with the nonvariable horizontal branch. The boundaries of the instability strip for M3 are determined. Period changes are determined and the implications for horizontal-branch evolution are discussed. Roughly a dozen variables were found to be fainter than the zero-age horizontal branch, suggesting smaller-than-average core masses. This may be related to the location of the stars in the cluster's central region.},

abstract = {We test competing models that aim at explaining the nature of stars in the Milky Way that are well away (|z|{\$}\gtrsim{\$} 1kpc) from the midplane, the so-called thick disk: the stars may have gotten there through orbital migration, through satellite mergers and accretion, or through heating of pre-existing thin disk stars. Sales et al. (2009) proposed the eccentricity distribution of thick disk stars as a diagnostic to differentiate between these mechanisms. Drawing on SDSS DR7, we have assembled a sample of 34,223 G-dwarfs with 6-D phase-space information and metallicities, and have derived orbital eccentricities for them. Comparing the resulting eccentricity distributions, p(e|z), with the models, we find that: a) the observed p(e|z) is inconsistent with that predicted by orbital migration only, as there are more observed stars of high and of very low eccentricity; b) scenarios where the thick disk is made predominantly through abrupt heating of a pre-existing thin disk are also inconsistent, as they predict more high-eccentricity stars than observed; c) the observed p(e|z) fits well with a "gas-rich merger" scenario, where most thick disk stars were born from unsettled gas in situ.},

So far the survey has discovered 497 variables in 380 deg2, lying from 4 to 60 kpc from the Sun. It has detected three statistically significant clumps of variables, which shows that outer halo does not have smooth density contours. One clump is located at 50 kpc from the galactic center, and it is probably tidal debris from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. A second structure, at 17 kpc from the galactic center, appears to be due to the tidal disruption of the globular cluster Pal 5. The third group, at 19 kpc, is not related with any known globular cluster or dwarf galaxy. The little that is known about its properties is consistent with it being debris from a disrupted galaxy.

title = {α-, r-, and s-process element trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks},
abstract = {From a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 102 F and G dwarf stars we present abundance trends in the Galactic thin and thick disks for 14 elements (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, Ba, and Eu). Stellar parameters and elemental abundances (except for Y, Ba and Eu) for 66 of the 102 stars were presented in our previous studies (Bensby et al. [CITE], A{\&}A, 410, 527, [CITE], A{\&}A, 415, 155). The 36 stars that are new in this study extend and confirm our previous results and allow us to draw further conclusions regarding abundance trends. The s-process elements Y and Ba, and the r-element Eu have also been considered here for the whole sample for the first time. With this new larger sample we now have the following results: 1) smooth and distinct abundance trends that for the thin and thick disks are clearly separated; 2) the α-element trends for the thick disk show typical signatures from the enrichment of SN Ia; 3) the thick disk stellar sample is in the mean older than the thin disk stellar sample; 4) the thick disk abundance trends are invariant with galactocentric radii (R_m); 5) the thick disk abundance trends appear to be invariant with vertical distance (Z_max) from the Galactic plane. Adding further evidence from the literaure we argue that a merger/interacting scenario with a companion galaxy to produce a kinematical heating of the stars (that make up today's thick disk) in a pre-existing old thin disk is the most likely formation scenario for the Galactic thick disk. The 102 stars have -1 ≲ [Fe/H] ≲ +0.4 and are all in the solar neighbourhood. Based on their kinematics they have been divided into a thin disk sample and a thick disk sample consisting of 60 and 38 stars, respectively. The remaining 4 stars have kinematics that make them kinematically intermediate to the two disks. Their chemical abundances also place them in between the two disks. Which of the two disk populations these 4 stars belong to, or if they form a distinct population of their own, can at the moment not be settled. The 66 stars from our previous studies were observed with the FEROS spectrograph on the ESO 1.5-m telescope and the CES spectrograph on the ESO 3.6-m telescope. Of the 36 new stars presented here 30 were observed with the SOFIN spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma, 3 with the UVES spectrograph on VLT/UT2, and 3 with the FEROS spectrograph on the ESO 1.5-m telescope. All spectra have high signal-to-noise ratios (typically S/N≳ 250) and high resolution (R˜ 80 000, 45 000, and 110 000 for the SOFIN, FEROS, and UVES spectra, respectively).

title = {Cold Dark Matter Substructure and Galactic Disks. I. Morphological Signatures of Hierarchical Satellite Accretion},
abstract = {We conduct dissipationless N-body simulations to investigate the cumulative effect of substructure impacts onto thin disk galaxies in the context of the ΛCDM paradigm. Our simulation campaign is based on a hybrid approach combining cosmological simulations and controlled numerical experiments. Substructure properties are culled from cosmological simulations of galaxy-sized CDM halos. We demonstrate that accretions of massive subhalos onto the central regions of host halos, where the galactic disk resides, since z~1 should be common occurrences. In contrast, extremely few satellites in present-day CDM halos are likely to have a significant impact on the disk structure. One host halo merger history is subsequently used to seed controlled N-body experiments of repeated satellite encounters with an initially thin Milky-Way (MW) type disk galaxy. These simulations track the effects of six dark matter substructures, with initial masses in the range ~(0.7-2)×1010 Msolar (~20%-60% of the disk mass), crossing the disk in the past ~8 Gyr. We demonstrate that these accretion events produce several distinctive morphological signatures in the disk, including long-lived, low surface brightness, ringlike features in the outskirts; significant flares; bars; and faint filamentary structures above the disk plane. The final distribution of disk stars exhibits a complex vertical structure that is well described by a standard ``thin-thick'' disk decomposition. We compare one of the resulting ringlike features in our simulations to the Monoceros Ring stellar structure in the MW. The comparison shows quantitative agreement in spatial distribution and kinematics, suggesting that such observed complex stellar components may arise naturally as disk stars are excited by encounters with CDM substructure. We conclude that satellite-disk interactions of the kind expected in ΛCDM models can induce morphological features in galactic disks that are similar to those being discovered in the Milky Way, M31, and other disk galaxies. These results highlight the significant role of CDM substructure in setting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution. Upcoming galactic structure surveys and astrometric satellites may be able to distinguish between competing cosmological models by testing whether the detailed structure of galactic disks is as excited as predicted by the CDM paradigm.},

title = {Cold Dark Matter Substructure and Galactic Disks. II. Dynamical Effects of Hierarchical Satellite Accretion},
abstract = {We perform a set of fully self-consistent, dissipationless N-body simulations to elucidate the dynamical response of thin galactic disks to bombardment by cold dark matter (CDM) substructure. Our method combines (1) cosmological simulations of the formation of Milky Way (MW)-sized CDM halos to derive the properties of substructure, and (2) controlled numerical experiments of consecutive subhalo impacts onto an initially thin, fully formed MW-type disk galaxy. The present study is the first to account for the evolution of satellite populations over cosmic time in such an investigation of disk structure. In contrast to what can be inferred from statistics of the z = 0 surviving substructure, we find that accretions of massive subhalos onto the central regions of host halos, where the galactic disks reside, since z ~ 1 should be common. One host halo accretion history is used to initialize the controlled simulations of satellite-disk encounters. The specific merger history involves six dark matter substructures, with initial masses in the range ~20%-60% of the disk mass and of comparable size to the disk, crossing the central regions of their host in the past ~8 Gyr. We show that these accretion events severely perturb the thin galactic disk and produce a wealth of distinctive dynamical signatures on its structure and kinematics. These include (1) considerable thickening and heating at all radii, with the disk thickness and velocity ellipsoid nearly doubling at the solar radius; (2) prominent flaring associated with an increase in disk thickness greater than a factor of 4 in the disk outskirts; (3) surface density excesses at large radii, beyond ~5 disk scale lengths, resembling those of the observed antitruncated disks; (4) long-lived, lopsidedness at levels similar to those measured in observational samples of disk galaxies; and (5) substantial tilting. The interaction with the most massive subhalo in the simulated accretion history drives the disk response while subsequent bombardment is much less efficient at disturbing the disk. We also explore a variety of disk and satellite properties that influence these responses. We conclude that substructure-disk encounters of the kind expected in the ΛCDM paradigm play a significant role in setting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution.},

title = {Chemical evolution with radial mixing},
abstract = {Models of the chemical evolution of our Galaxy are extended to include radial migration of stars and flow of gas through the disc. The models track the production of both iron and α-elements. A model is chosen that provides an excellent fit to the metallicity distribution of stars in the Geneva-Copenhagen survey (GCS) of the solar neighbourhood and a good fit to the local Hess diagram. The model provides a good fit to the distribution of GCS stars in the age-metallicity plane, although this plane was not used in the fitting process. Although this model's star formation rate is monotonically declining, its disc naturally splits into an α-enhanced thick disc and a normal thin disc. In particular, the model's distribution of stars in the ([O/Fe], [Fe/H]) plane resembles that of Galactic stars in displaying a ridge line for each disc. The thin-disc's ridge line is entirely due to stellar migration, and there is the characteristic variation of stellar angular momentum along it that has been noted by Haywood in survey data. Radial mixing of stellar populations with high σz from inner regions of the disc to the solar neighbourhood provides a natural explanation of why measurements yield a steeper increase of σz with age than predicted by theory. The metallicity gradient in the interstellar medium is predicted to be steeper than in earlier models, but appears to be in good agreement with data for both our Galaxy and external galaxies. The models are inconsistent with a cut-off in the star formation rate at low gas surface densities. The absolute magnitude of the disc is given as a function of time in several photometric bands, and radial colour profiles are plotted for representative times.},

Although the simulation's star formation rate declines monotonically from its unique peak and no merger or tidal event ever takes place, the model replicates all known properties of a thick disc, as well as matching special features of the local stellar population such as a metal-poor extension of the thin disc that has high rotational velocity.

title = {The influence of interactions and minor mergers on the structure of galactic disks. II. Results and interpretations},
abstract = {We present the second part of a detailed statistical study focussed on the effects of tidal interactions and minor mergers on the radial and vertical disk structure of spiral galaxies. In the first part we reported on the sample selection, observations, and applied disk models. In this paper the results are presented, based on disk parameters derived from a sample of 110 highly-inclined/edge-on galaxies. This sample consists of two subsamples of 49 interacting/merging and 61 non-interacting galaxies. Additionally, 41 of these galaxies were observed in the NIR. We find significant changes of the disk structure in vertical direction, resulting in ~ 1.5 times larger scale heights and thus vertical velocity dispersions. The radial disk structure, characterized by the cut-off radius and the scale length, shows no statistically significant changes. Thus, the ratio of radial to vertical scale parameters, h/z0, is ~ 1.7 times smaller for the sample of interacting/merging galaxies. The total lack of typical flat disk ratios h/z0 > 7 in the latter sample implies that vertical disk heating is most efficient for (extremely) thin disks. Statistically nearly all galactic disks in the sample (93%) possess non-isothermal vertical luminosity profiles like the sech (60%) and exp (33%) distribution, independent of the sample and passband investigated. This indicates that, in spite of tidal perturbations and disk thickening, the initial vertical distribution of disk stars is not destroyed by interactions or minor mergers.

title = {Halo Velocity Groups in the Pisces Overdensity},
abstract = {We report spectroscopic observations of five faint (V ~ 20) RR Lyrae stars associated with the Pisces overdensity conducted with the Gemini South Telescope. At a heliocentric and galactocentric distance of ~80 kpc, this is the most distant substructure in the Galactic halo known to date. We combined our observations with literature data and confirmed that the substructure is composed of two different kinematic groups. The main group contains eight stars and has langV gsrrang = 50 km s-1, while the second group contains four stars at a velocity of langV gsrrang = -52 km s-1, where V gsr is the radial velocity in the galactocentric standard of rest. The metallicity distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Pisces overdensity is centered on [Fe/H] = -1.5 dex and has a width of 0.3 dex. The new data allowed us to establish that both groups are spatially extended making it very unlikely that they are bound systems, and are more likely to be debris of a tidally disrupted galaxy or galaxies. Due to small sky coverage, it is still unclear whether these groups have the same or different progenitors.},

The images of these galaxies show significant resolved stellar populations. We derive F606W and F814W photometry for more than 1.2 million stars and present color-magnitude diagrams that show a mixture of young, intermediate, and old stars in each galaxy. In one of the fields we serendipitously detect stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud. We also identify a candidate young dwarf galaxy lying ~2 kpc above the plane of NGC 4631. For the nearest six galaxies, we derive tip of the red giant branch distances and demonstrate that these galaxies fall on the K-band Tully-Fisher relation established in clusters. From the color of the red giant branch, we also find evidence that these galaxies possess a metal-poor thick-disk or halo population.},

title = {Thick-disk Evolution Induced by the Growth of an Embedded Thin Disk},
abstract = {We perform collisionless N-body simulations to investigate the evolution of the structural and kinematical properties of simulated thick disks induced by the growth of an embedded thin disk. The thick disks used in the present study originate from cosmologically common 5:1 encounters between initially thin primary disk galaxies and infalling satellites. The growing thin disks are modeled as static gravitational potentials and we explore a variety of growing-disk parameters that are likely to influence the response of thick disks. We find that the final thick-disk properties depend strongly on the total mass and radial scale length of the growing thin disk, and much less sensitively on its growth timescale and vertical scale height as well as the initial sense of thick-disk rotation. Overall, the growth of an embedded thin disk can cause a substantial contraction in both the radial and vertical direction, resulting in a significant decrease in the scale lengths and scale heights of thick disks. Kinematically, a growing thin disk can induce a notable increase in the mean rotation and velocity dispersions of thick-disk stars. We conclude that the reformation of a thin disk via gas accretion may play a significant role in setting the structure and kinematics of thick disks, and thus it is an important ingredient in models of thick-disk formation.},

title = {Simulations of minor mergers - I. General properties of thick discs},
abstract = {We present simulations of the formation of thick discs via the accretion of two-component satellites onto a pre-existing thin disc. Our goal is to establish the detailed characteristics of the thick discs obtained in this way, as well as their dependence on the initial orbital and internal properties of the accreted objects. We find that mergers with 10-20 per cent mass of the host lead to the formation of thick discs whose characteristics are similar, both in morphology as in kinematics, to those observed. Despite the relatively large mass ratios, the host discs are not fully destroyed by the infalling satellites: a remaining kinematically cold and thin component containing ~15-25 per cent of the mass can be identified, which is embedded in a hotter and thicker disc. This may for example, explain the existence of a very old thin disc stars in the Milky Way. The final scaleheights of the discs depend both on the initial inclination and properties of the merger, but the fraction of satellite stellar particles at ~4 scaleheights directly measures the mass ratio between the satellite and host galaxy. Our thick discs typically show boxy isophotes at very low surface brightness levels (>6mag below their peak value). Kinematically, the velocity ellipsoids of the simulated thick discs are similar to that of the Galactic thick disc at the solar radius. The trend of with radius is found to be a very good discriminant of the initial inclination of the accreted satellite. In the Milky Way, the possible existence of a vertical gradient in the rotational velocity of the thick disc as well as the observed value of at the solar vicinity appear to favour the formation of the thick disc by a merger with either low or intermediate orbital inclination.},

title = {Stellar Chemical Signatures and Hierarchical Galaxy Formation},
abstract = {To compare the chemistries of stars in the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellite galaxies with stars in the Galaxy, we have compiled a large sample of Galactic stellar abundances from the literature. When kinematic information is available, we have assigned the stars to standard Galactic components through Bayesian classification based on Gaussian velocity ellipsoids. As found in previous studies, the [α/Fe] ratios of most stars in the dSph galaxies are generally lower than similar metallicity Galactic stars in this extended sample. Our kinematically selected stars confirm this for the Galactic halo, thin-disk, and thick-disk components. There is marginal overlap in the low [α/Fe] ratios between dSph stars and Galactic halo stars on extreme retrograde orbits (V<-420 km s-1), but this is not supported by other element ratios. Other element ratios compared in this paper include r- and s-process abundances, where we find a significant offset in the [Y/Fe] ratios, which results in a large overabundance in [Ba/Y] in most dSph stars compared with Galactic stars. Thus, the chemical signatures of most of the dSph stars are distinct from the stars in each of the kinematic components of the Galaxy. This result rules out continuous merging of low-mass galaxies similar to these dSph satellites during the formation of the Galaxy. However, we do not rule out very early merging of low-mass dwarf galaxies, since up to one-half of the most metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<=-1.8) have chemistries that are in fair agreement with Galactic halo stars. We also do not rule out merging with higher mass galaxies, although we note that the LMC and the remnants of the Sgr dwarf galaxy are also chemically distinct from the majority of the Galactic halo stars. Formation of the Galaxy's thick disk by heating of an old thin disk during a merger is also not ruled out; however, the Galaxy's thick disk itself cannot be comprised of the remnants from a low-mass (dSph) dwarf galaxy, nor of a high-mass dwarf galaxy like the LMC or Sgr, because of differences in chemistry. The new and independent environments offered by the dSph galaxies also allow us to examine fundamental assumptions related to the nucleosynthesis of the elements. The metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<=-1.8) in the dSph galaxies appear to have lower [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] than [Mg/Fe] ratios, unlike similar metallicity stars in the Galaxy. Predictions from the α-process (α-rich freeze-out) would be consistent with this result if there have been a lack of hypernovae in dSph galaxies. The α-process could also be responsible for the very low Y abundances in the metal-poor stars in dSph's; since [La/Eu] (and possibly [Ba/Eu]) are consistent with pure r-process results, the low [Y/Eu] suggests a separate r-process site for this light (first-peak) r-process element. We also discuss SNe II rates and yields as other alternatives, however. In stars with higher metallicities ([Fe/H]>=-1.8), contributions from the s-process are expected; [(Y, La, and Ba)/Eu] all rise as expected, and yet [Ba/Y] is still much higher in the dSph stars than similar metallicity Galactic stars. This result is consistent with s-process contributions from lower metallicity AGB stars in dSph galaxies, and is in good agreement with the slower chemical evolution expected in the low-mass dSph galaxies relative to the Galaxy, such that the build-up of metals occurs over much longer timescales. Future investigations of nucleosynthetic constraints (as well as galaxy formation and evolution) will require an examination of many stars within individual dwarf galaxies. Finally, the Na-Ni trend reported in 1997 by Nissen {\&} Schuster is confirmed in Galactic halo stars, but we discuss this in terms of the general nucleosynthesis of neutron-rich elements. We do not confirm that the Na-Ni trend is related to the accretion of dSph galaxies in the Galactic halo.},

title = {Computation of the Fourier parameters of RR Lyrae stars by template fitting},
abstract = {Aims:Due to the importance of accurate Fourier parameters, we devise a method that is more appropriate for deriving these parameters for low-quality data than the traditional Fourier fitting. Methods: Based on the accurate light curves of 248 fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars, we test the power of a full-fetched implementation of the template method in the computation of the Fourier decomposition. The applicability of the method is also demonstrated on data sets of filter passbands different from those of the template set. Results: We examine in more detail the question of the estimation of Fourier-based iron abundance [Fe/H] and average brightness. We get, for example, for light curves sampled randomly in 30 data points with ?~C=0.03 mag observational noise, that optimized direct Fourier fits yield ?~C([Fe/H])=0.33, whereas the template fits result in ?~C([Fe/H])=0.18. Tests made on the RR Lyrae database of the Large Magellanic Cloud of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment support the applicability of the method on real photometric time series. These tests also show that the dominant part of error in estimating the average brightness comes from other sources, most probably from crowding effects, even for under-sampled light curves.},
